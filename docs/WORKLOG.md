# Work log — 24 October 2026

## Commands and results

- Inspected the empty workspace; no applicable AGENTS.md found. Initialized outer
  Git repository on `port/douglas-bringup`. No remote added and nothing pushed.
- Initial sandbox network Git failed DNS resolution; approved network execution
  succeeded. This was an environment restriction, not an unavailable repository.
- Queried official Android/AOSP and Lineage release sources. Retrieved official
  Lineage changelogs with curl after web-reader 403 responses.
- Used `git ls-remote`, shallow `git clone --depth 1`, GitHub public REST metadata
  and selected raw source files. Exact clone commits/URLs are in the source lock.
- Inspected device/common/kernel/vendor/hardware sources, release notes, original
  and newer amonet source, current amazon-oss common/giza trees and compatibility
  patches. Never executed the exploit or repository installer scripts.
- Enumerated direct forks and searched related newer MT8163 work. Found explicit
  douglas board support in amazon-oss 4.9.337, including its lineage-22.2 branch.
- Read actual Android 17/Lineage 24 `NetBpfLoad.cpp` runtime gates. Copies saved.
  Lineage 24 Connectivity head inspected: `7c04d866538e6f689823b769fb5c1e614ca0e295`.
- Fetched official Play HTML, decoded its embedded JSON and checked the scraper
  field mapping. Extracted current Home minimum Android/version metadata.
- Created device branch `port/android11-bringup` at `4c557e6...`.
- Fixed wrong optional vendor inheritance (`vendor/douglas/douglas` →
  `vendor/amazon/douglas`) and made common BoardConfig inclusion mandatory.
  Saved the actual diff in `patches/0001-douglas-require-correct-vendor-and-common-paths.patch`.
  This prevents silently dropping device vendor files or common configuration.
- Probed all eight existing platform patches against pinned Android 11 touched
  files. Five failed, three applied. Initially Git skipped fixtures because it
  discovered the enclosing repository; corrected isolation with
  `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES`, added a skipped-patch guard, and reran. Only the
  corrected results are retained as evidence.
- Rebased existing bitmap patch native paths to Android 11's `libs/hwui/jni/`.
  Its three-file applicability check passes. No new graphics behavior was invented;
  inherited workaround semantics still require review and hardware tests.
- Added restore, offline source checks, patch probe and host preflight scripts;
  pinned dependency manifests and an unbuilt Linux container recipe.
- User confirmed Fire OS 5.7.1.0, 12.33 GB internal capacity (16 GB SKU), separate
  30 GB SD card, CP4 lab on latest firmware, and full Home functionality required.

## Validation and limits

`python3 scripts/check_sources.py`: PASS for source pins, manifest paths, corrected
inheritance and six ARM/ARM64 graphics blob ELF headers.

`python3 scripts/probe_android11_patches.py`: saved independent applicability
results, including actual missing Android 11 bitmap paths and context failures.
The rebased bitmap patch passes. This is a partial source fixture, not a platform
checkout. It cannot validate module dependencies, compilation or runtime behavior.

`git -C sources/device-douglas diff --check`: passed.

`python3 scripts/preflight.py`: exit 2, expected; host is arm64 macOS, filesystem
is case-insensitive and free disk is ~42 GiB. RAM is 36 GiB.

Legacy kernel clone emitted case-collision warnings for netfilter headers/sources
and an rcutorture filename. Those apparent tracked modifications must not be
exported as development patches. Restore that repository on case-sensitive Linux.

No Android build, image generation, full repo sync, GApps download, APK download,
paid resource use, tablet connection, unlock, wipe, flash or physical test occurred.
The existing release ROM (~482 MB) was not downloaded. Inspection sources occupy
roughly 1.1 GB expanded before small source fixtures.

## Direction clarified after initial investigation

The user selected a current maintained Android kernel that moves with Android releases,
using the old kernel trees as hardware references. General-purpose tablet usefulness is
the primary goal; Crestron Home is one application requirement. Optional hardware-absent
features may be unavailable with accurate declarations. The prior old-kernel/intermediate-
Android progression is superseded. Updated README, maintenance direction, feasibility
conclusion and continuation notes to agree. No new porting/build/device work was started;
waiting for the user's next instructions.

## Crestron panel-mode scope

User added a separate question about native Crestron panel behavior and clarified that
the setup interface selects an application/use, then runs one app at a time. Official
TSW-70 documentation confirms this model. Added a panel-mode research track to the
maintenance document, distinguishing supported Android/web clients from an unverified
native-runtime port. Found official Android clients for Smart Graphics (Go) and
HTML5/Construct (ONE, documented Android 14+), plus Android browser Web XPanel support.
No claim that arbitrary native panel applications can run on douglas; no prototype,
firmware extraction, large download or device operation was undertaken.

## Crestron research completed after user authorization

- Verified the native single-selected-app model against TSW-70 documentation.
- Located the real public app-update manifest. Initial `70series` URL attempts
  returned 404; corrected `70-series` spelling using official release-note evidence.
- Checked archive sizes with HTTP HEAD and reported the approximately 79 MiB total
  before downloading HTML5 host, General Web and touchscreen Home archives.
- Preserved download/source metadata, hashes and extracted manifests under
  `evidence/crestron/`. APKs and full selected disassembly remain ignored under
  `work/crestron/`. No APK or native library was run or modified.
- Used installed Android SDK `apkanalyzer` and Java 25.0.2 for static inspection.
  Identified ARM32-only bundled native libraries, explicit loads of missing
  `cresstore_jsonJNI`/`SecureStorageJNI`, localhost signal transport, and General
  Web's signal bridge. These are observed dependency contracts, not runtime results.
- Public firmware manifest was readable and advertised `3.003.0021.001`; its exact
  firmware URL returned HTTP 404 on HEAD. An older tested URL also returned 404.
  Did not download a full PUF, BSP or emulator image. No emulator is configured here.
- Checked official Home/Go/ONE/Web XPanel deployment paths, native CH5 video
  architecture, Android lock-task APIs, Microsoft certification documentation,
  Zoom Android controller requirements, and current Crestron mobility-license status.
- Searched public repositories and inspected CrestronKeeper at pinned commit
  `6546f94d2864614c8cc5ca069fad0c39b3b75f69`; it targets the old mobile app and is
  a launcher/lifecycle reference, not a native-runtime port.
- Added `scripts/inspect_crestron_apps.py` to reproduce archive verification,
  manifest/native-library inventory and selected class inspection. Added
  `docs/CRESTRON-PANEL.md` with a project direction and gated native-service milestone.
- Retained the current-kernel/general-purpose Android objective. No OS/kernel
  implementation, physical testing, processor program change, account messaging,
  paid-resource provisioning or native compatibility prototype was performed.

## 2026-10-24 — GitHub project split and CI

User supplied TOVSWORLD/Firetab-Android and authorized publishing the starting repository.
Added two project entry points with separate scope, acceptance and validation records:
`projects/firetabs-android` and `projects/crestron-panel`. Shared evidence and tools retain
existing paths to preserve reproducible commands. These are repository projects, not
separate GitHub repositories or GitHub Projects boards.

Read actual Valethon AI guidance and CI checks as reference. Adapted verification,
anti-vaporware, canonical evidence, truncation detection, and focused blocking checks.
Added three read-only GitHub Actions jobs, offline checker and rejection-path tests.
No paid model service, privileged runner, large build/download or physical device action.
Firmware and panel execution stages remain explicitly `not_run`.

Published initial main revision `82c7fc4`; GitHub run 40158159017 passed all three
jobs and six rejection-path tests. Updated checkout to the pinned v6 revision after
reviewing the hosted runner warning about the v4 Node runtime.

## 2026-10-24 — Development-to-main release policy

User required main to be locked except for development-to-main releases. Created
`development`, enabled CI on integration pushes and added a metadata-only source-branch
check. Main requires release PRs from the same repository's development branch.
No PR code executes in the privileged-event workflow; token permissions stay read-only.

## 2026-10-24 — Public contribution and release process

Added public contribution, conduct, governance, security, support and provenance docs;
architecture, setup, testing, troubleshooting, roadmap, decision and release guides.
Defined independent product SemVer streams and source-workspace tags, with a conditional
monthly first-Tuesday window and explicit stable/LTS acceptance. No release was published.

Implemented release-manifest checks and rejection tests; added tracked documentation-link
and form/taxonomy checks to Repository integrity. Created seven issue forms, CODEOWNERS,
release-note categories and monthly Actions dependency PR configuration. License selection
is awaiting the owner; external code/doc merge acceptance is explicitly held meanwhile.

Applied 27 labels, three milestones and eight bounded native parent/sub-issues.
Seed identities are recorded in projects/github-setup.json; the reconciliation script
preserves existing issue bodies and states. Enabled private vulnerability reporting.
Active tag ruleset 25808738 blocks updates/deletion for all three release tag prefixes.
No model service, full build, firmware upload or physical test was performed.

## 2026-10-25 — Actual GitHub Projects

The earlier split created folders and parent issues, not GitHub Projects. Created
FireTabs Android (#4) and Crestron Panel (#5), linked both to the repository, and
added project-specific issues plus shared repository tasks. Recorded board identities
and preserved them across metadata reconciliation. Public visibility awaits explicit
owner approval after automatic approval review rejected that separate visibility change.

## 2026-10-25 — Issue #5 maintained-kernel candidate/support audit

Inspected pinned Android 17 ACK, recent bengris32 MT8163 work (including an explicit
douglas DTS), its separate upstream submission and LibreEcho 6.1 source references.
Recommended the Android 17 / 6.18 ACK family with an exact LTS-integration candidate,
recording development/release-ref version differences rather than claiming latest
security coverage from the name. Added twelve source-anchored component records.

Captured 78 source/listing records plus three upstream license/notice records with hashes; 16 MT8163 binding-header paths are absent
at the inspected ACK pin. Reproduced a clang preprocessing failure at the first missing
clock header and recorded the actual command/error. Added offline source verification
and rejection tests to CI. No complete kernel checkout/toolchain/AOSP sync or paid
resources; no kernel compilation, image packing, APK execution or physical device actions.

Documented stock mt-boot vs PSCI/power sequencing, memory/boot-envelope concerns,
32-bit EL0/userspace distinctions, graphics/CDD gaps and the next minimal compile/resource
plan. Hardware validation records remain not_run; this closes an audit, not a port.

## 2026-10-25 — Issue #14 DT dependency closure and actual compilation

Resolved 26 real pinned DTS/header inputs (20 donor, six ACK); built dtc 1.8.1 in an
isolated workspace with pinned small bootstrap inputs. The unmodified source failed
on missing thermal constants. Two patches add the real include and correct memory
unit naming/cooling declarations. The patched tree compiles without diagnostics to
a 26,283-byte DTB; fdtget inspection verifies board identity and preserves explicit
512 MiB/PSCI donor assumptions. These are not validated physical hardware facts.

Added a reproducible offline build/inspection command, Linux CI compilation and input/
artifact-integrity tests. No compiled DTB is committed or published. Kernel and device
validation stages stay not_run. A separate schema attempt used incomplete binding
context and is explicitly not passed despite the validator's zero exit code.
The tool-specific SWIG incompatibility was fixed by a compatible pinned dependency,
not by suppressing C errors. No full kernel/AOSP download or physical device action.

## 2026-10-25 — Issue #16 generic ACK compiler baseline

Reconciled closed issue #9's stale status and moved Android root #2 and task #16
into progress on the Android board. Added an isolated Linux CI experiment for
ACK d9318bdb4c34e8b2d997b4f67ced56b120b22b87 with Ubuntu LLVM 18.
The source's scripts/min-tool-version.sh requires LLVM >=15; Kconfig.ext is an
existing intentionally empty upstream placeholder, so no source stub is added.
Uses ARM64 defconfig, not GKI/douglas config. Source fetch shallow/no tags,
3 GiB post-transfer budget, 15 GiB free-disk and 7 GiB RAM gates, 60 minute timeout.
Runner compiler/package versions are recorded, not hermetically pinned. The
experiment logs the resolved config, ELF architecture, artifact sizes/hashes.
No boot image packaging, upload/release or device access. Compilation outcome
must be read from CI before marking any validation gate complete.

First Linux run 40168107152 stopped in host-tool preflight: pahole absent.
No kernel source was fetched. Added Ubuntu dwarves/libelf-dev/libssl-dev host
packages with installed versions logged; apt repositories remain host-dependent.

## 2026-10-25 — Start issue #18 source integration

#16 kernel compile is still pending; it remains open. Started #18's independent
source comparison on kernel/mt8163-clock-port, based on the unmerged #17 branch.
Retrieved 15 pinned source/API files (98,463 decoded bytes). Prepared nine real
clock drivers and eleven binding headers, donor build wiring, and lifecycle/factor
registration corrections documented in the overlay README. Added a clock compile
mode that verifies seven enabled symbols, builds affected objects with W=1 and
then a full generic Image. No clock compilation or hardware pass is yet claimed.
The Linux run uses the previously reported per-run 3 GiB source budget and host
resource gates; no full Android checkout, paid host or device access is involved.

Clock run 40168938776 reached real compilation and failed on missing direct-update
mux macros/ops and flags-selectable composite initializer. Backported the donor's
actual direct-update operations as a minimal ACK patch, leaving existing ACK ops
and allocation implementation intact. Preserved audio composite flags=0 rather
than silently substituting ACK's rate-propagating macro. Rebuild pending.

Generic ACK compile run 40168232549 succeeded: ARM64 4 KiB Image 41,286,144
bytes, vmlinux 440,617,560 bytes; ~16 min 34 sec including fetch/config/build.
Recorded result metadata and recovered the full config from CI logs; its SHA256
matches the compiler-run checksum. No compiler warning/error lines were found.
This generic config does not enable Android Binder/SELinux; it is not the target
Android/douglas config and does not advance that kernel validation record.
PR #17 merged to development. Full matching binding/schema work is now tracked
explicitly in #27; driver/configuration work in #18–#25. Exact transfer and
expanded checkout sizes were not emitted and remain unknown.

Rebuild 40169238323 compiled all nine MT8163 clock objects with W=1 and advanced
into the full kernel build before being superseded by the evidence-recording
commit. Full Image linkage with the overlay is still pending. A git-apply blank
line warning in generated Kconfig wiring was fixed; no warning flag was disabled.
Added per-PR concurrency cancellation to avoid duplicate obsolete builds.

## 2026-10-25 — Clock reference follow-through

Added a bounded source audit of nine provider files and 102 literal DT clock
references. Provider header/ID checks pass; three literal HDMI parents remain
unresolved and documented, not hidden with aliases/dummy clocks. This is not a
schema/register/runtime validation. Heavy kernel experiments now run on PR open,
ready-for-review or explicit workflow_dispatch, rather than on every documentation
push. Source-affecting updates require an explicit rebuild at the new revision;
repository validation continues on every PR update. Run 40169479688's clock source
is unchanged by this audit/documentation/workflow-trigger update.

## 2026-10-25 — Prepare pinctrl/EINT object probe (#19)

While the #18 full kernel compile runs, prepared the next source integration as
a separate stacked change: three unmodified donor files and real Kconfig/Makefile
wiring. ACK common APIs/data fields exist; donor declares 155 pins, six EINT
ports/169 AP interrupts/64 debounce entries. These are not hardware measurements.
A bounded Linux W=1 object-only probe will record actual ELF/hash/config results.
Full Image linkage, legacy routing comparison and schema/runtime tests remain
required. No pinctrl compilation pass is claimed before CI executes.

Pinctrl reference audit: all 155 donor pin names, literal mux functions and EINT
mappings match the pinned legacy Git object; 15 unique captured modern DT mux
references map to descriptor entries. Original legacy table and hashes retained.
This is a source comparison, not register/schema/electrical validation.

Pinctrl object run 40169973832 passed with W=1 and zero compiler warning/error
lines. ELF64 AArch64 object SHA256 recorded in evidence/pinctrl-port/object-result.json.
Git storage measured 291,136 KiB; source including Git 2,066,692 KiB. Transfer bytes
remain unknown. Source is unchanged by the subsequent audit/evidence/CI additions.
Added both bounded reference audits to ordinary repository CI. #19 remains open:
full Image integration, complete schema/register review and all runtime evidence
are still pending.

Expanded pinctrl audit: drive groups (3), pin-drive entries (119), special pulls
(46) and Schmitt entries (57) match legacy. The donor adds one input-enable entry
for GPIO87/MSDC2_DAT0, 0xcf0 bit 4; retained as an unvalidated donor delta and
recorded explicitly. No register value was changed to force an audit pass.

Added explicit workflow_dispatch mode clocks-pinctrl for full combined Image
integration after the object probe. It applies both pinned overlays, verifies
PINCTRL_MT8163=y and all clock symbols, compiles both directories with W=1 and
links Image/vmlinux. This is still a generic config, not a douglas boot claim.

## 2026-10-25 — Prepare #20 PMIC/power object integration

Prepared a minimal MT8163 wrapper/power-domain patch against actual pinned ACK
files. Wrapper donor differences are MT8163-specific. Power core keeps ACK's
implementation and imports only MT8163 include/match data and bus-protection
masks, excluding unrelated hardware-voter/SMC changes from donor 7.0. Eight-domain
header/binding retain donor licenses. Static wrapper register-offset comparison
against pinned legacy header is recorded; runtime sequencing is unverified.
Added bounded W=1 object probe; compilation result is not yet claimed.

Added a reproducible PMIC wrapper register-offset audit to ordinary CI; 79 shared
named offsets match the pinned legacy header. No initialization transactions or
power transitions are executed. This audit addition leaves probed driver source
unchanged from the initial #30 commit.

Power object run 40170813712 passed: actual wrapper and common power-domain
objects are AArch64 ELF, W=1, zero compiler warning/error lines. Hashes and
measured source/Git storage are recorded in evidence/power-port/object-result.json.
Full Image integration, binding dependencies and runtime power sequencing remain
open on #20. This does not advance any Android/douglas runtime validation gate.
## 2026-10-25 — Begin diagnostic boot-contract investigation (#21)

Captured pinned legacy runtime-memory readers and ACK PSCI implementation.
ACK supports old explicit-ID arm,psci as well as version-probed bindings; the
legacy vendor MTCMOS sequence remains a separate unresolved delta. Both legacy
and donor source DTs say 512 MiB; runtime DRAM/mblock inputs and actual loader
fixups must be resolved rather than guessing a RAM replacement. Recorded reserved
region discrepancies and a staged diagnostic/log/recovery plan. Inspected amonet
source only; no unlock/helper/device operation or image packing performed.
#21 remains open pending actual firmware/memory/loader and recovery evidence.

Clock Image run 40169479688 succeeded at 07:09 UTC, about 36 minutes including
setup/fetch/object/full build, with no compiler warning/error lines. Actual
AArch64 Image is 41,351,680 bytes; SHA256 and vmlinux/config metadata recorded in
evidence/kernel-compile/clock-image-result.json. Clock source is unchanged by
the later audit/documentation update. PR #26 merged to development. Schema #27
and parent resolution #29 remain open; no target boot/runtime gate is promoted.

## 2026-10-25 — Local boot image inspector (#32)

Implemented a regular-file-only, read-only header-v0 layout/hash/partition-fit
inspector supporting #21. Rejects ambiguous formats, malformed pages, oversized
or truncated input; counts unclassified tail bytes. Does not decompress, extract,
pack, access device nodes/USB or claim signatures/bootability. Ten synthetic
boundary/rejection tests added; 31 total tests pass. No real stock image inspected.

## 2026-10-25 — Combined clock/pinctrl Image passed

Run 40170429213 at c61bc28 completed at 07:26 UTC (~38 minutes): full AArch64
Image 41,363,968 bytes, with clock and pinctrl objects compiled under W=1 and
zero compiler warning/error lines. Result/hashes and recovered full config are
in evidence/pinctrl-port; config hash matches CI output. Later branch updates
are evidence/docs/CI/base synchronization, leaving these driver sources intact.
PR #28 refreshed against development for required checks; no policy bypass used.
No douglas boot, Android configuration, schema or hardware pass is claimed.

Added explicit providers workflow mode for the next full Image integration:
clock, pinctrl, PMIC wrapper and eight-domain controller candidates together.
Checks all resolved config symbols, compiles each affected object set with W=1,
then links the full generic Image. Same existing resource gates; no Android or
bootable device package is produced. Results pending until actual CI completion.
## 2026-10-25 — Console/MMC reuse investigation (#22)

Captured exact ACK UART/MMC drivers and schemas (133,433 decoded bytes). Prior
successful Image run 40170429213 actually compiled both built-in drivers;
compiler excerpts and configuration hash are retained. Donor fallbacks and
clock names match driver interfaces, while voltage/timing/DMA and physical log
capture remain unverified. ACK schemas do not list the MT8163 compatibles: an
explicit #27 follow-up, not a driver or hardware validation pass. No new kernel
build was launched to duplicate already-recorded compilation.

## 2026-10-25 — Full ACK binding corpus diagnostic (#27)

Retrieved the exact ACK bindings archive: 3,275,172 bytes, 5,186 YAML files,
SHA256 4d1108f17127afcb03d3f1b45a3721195572c8048078ebe821eb0edb94d1e526.
Added bounded/hash-verified archive recipe and full-context wrapper. Actual run
with dtschema 2026.9 reports 36 validation errors and 61 unmatched-schema entries.
Both upstream tools return zero despite diagnostics; wrapper returns 1 and
passed=false. One upstream Gunyah YAML file fails parsing and is preserved, so
this remains provisional corpus processing, not a complete matched schema pass.
Logs/structured errors expose real PMIC/interrupt-node mismatches and compatible
coverage gaps. No diagnostics suppressed and no hardware test performed.

## 2026-10-25 — Narrow PMIC DT structural fix (#27)

Added a separate candidate renaming three PMIC child nodes to the pinned binding
names, retaining labels/compatibles and all properties. DTB compiles without
diagnostics: 26,275 bytes / 119b6666a3caf217675d5aead3e9b0e0b21287d3e21f9d36e7d047f26698eddf.
Binary comparison confirms identical 880 property values across 186 nodes after
only allowed path substitutions. Full-context validation changes 36->34 errors,
61 unmatched unchanged, zero added diagnostic signatures; still passed=false.
Did not add domain cells to the PMIC shutdown node: reviewed driver provides a
sys-off handler, not genpd. Stored source evidence and retained this diagnostic
for semantic review. Added four comparison rejection tests; 35 total tests pass.

## 2026-10-25 — Full provider Image succeeded (#20)

Run 40173436578 at e4e4468 completed 08:13 UTC (~37 min), with real clock,
pinctrl, PMIC wrapper and power-domain objects built W=1 and full Image linked.
AArch64 Image 41,363,968 bytes / SHA256
8b8db531704f2f895e752ba1e22f1b6920b85426e1768a37730041f695afb39e.
Zero compiler warning/error lines. Config hash equals the retained pinctrl
combined config; provider source changes are real and Image/vmlinux hashes differ.
Result metadata retained. This generic configuration has no appended board DT,
qualified loader/ramdisk contract or hardware/Android runtime validation.

## 2026-10-25 — Prepare user-run read-only stock facts (#37)

Added explicit-serial/wrong-device refusal, fixed metadata command collection,
cmdline allowlisting, binary DT property handling, no serial/stderr persistence,
and enforced pipe/runtime limits. Six fake/host-only tests added; 41 total tests
pass. No real device transport executed. Checked installed SDK adb version only:
36.0.2-14143358 on shared Mac; this host-only command does not query devices.
Documented connection/debugging authorization separately from collector scope.
Actual stock facts remain needed for #21; no boot/test package is ready yet.


## 2026-10-25 — Classify PMIC shutdown schema selection (#27)

Traced the missing domain-cells diagnostic to the pinned generic power-domain
schema's node-name selector. The MFD binding itself calls the sys-off child
power-controller but does not require cells. Preserved the generic schema with
source hash and documented the selection overlap, MFD-provided memory resource,
and sys-off driver semantics. No permissive schema or DT change; counts remain
34 errors/61 unmatched. Actual stock-data collection still awaits the user's
computer choice; no tablet transport or settings change performed.

## 2026-10-25 — Sysirq node-name structural fix (#27)

Added isolated sysirq-node-name candidate on the PMIC candidate, preserving all
interrupt properties and compatibles. Clean DTC result 26,279 bytes / SHA256
78fd34cbe0c129da23dd2e296be0db9180e7d8b464e719b59304f09d01456bea.
Actual binary comparison retains 880 values across 186 nodes, permitting only
four reviewed path renames. Schema run removes one naming diagnostic with none
added after path normalization: 33 errors/61 unmatched remain, passed=false;
upstream YAML parse issue remains. Added CI compilation/property comparison and
rejection tests; 44 local tests pass. No physical device access or firmware pack.

## 2026-10-25 — Minimal diagnostic userspace experiment (#41)

Created separate freestanding AArch64 /init and deterministic newc/gzip builder.
Only console output, bounded kernel metadata reads, read-only virtual mounts and
controlled idle; no block nodes/storage mounts or reboot interface. Local Apple
Clang cross-object compile passes strict warnings; no local Linux linker present,
so full ELF/archive compilation is delegated to the existing Linux CI toolchain.
47 unit tests pass, including ELF rejection and actual archive metadata/content
parsing. Build is not a firmware package or a boot/runtime result. No tablet
transport or physical changes. Stock loader/memory/recovery gates remain #21.

Linux CI run 40181473575 at cb82cb8 passed the static ELF/archive build with
Ubuntu Clang 18.1.3; ELF checks confirm AArch64 ET_EXEC with no interpreter or
dynamic segment. Gzip/newc archive 1,248 bytes, SHA256
8d68234297e9ed50e025cb321d066b2d4ff8a4a09c57a654e09d9467c10e6ff4.
Exact command/compiler/source and artifact hashes retained in
 evidence/diagnostic-initramfs/compile-result.json. No runtime execution occurred.

## 2026-10-25 — Narrow local UART binding proposal (#27/#22)

Added opt-in mt8163-uart-proposed binding profile, preserving the original ACK
profile. Proposal adds only the exact MT8163 first compatible with required
MT6577 fallback, backed by pinned donor DT and matching ACK driver source.
Original schema/patch/proposed schema hashes checked before applying in a fresh
corpus extraction. Meta-validation clean; full-context diagnostic delta removes
four compatible errors and four unmatched entries without added signatures:
29 errors/57 unmatched remain, upstream YAML parse issue remains, passed=false.
49 tests pass, including real isolated patch application and rejection of changed
original schema input. No compatible deletion, permissive schema or hardware claim.

## 2026-10-25 — Restricted diagnostic kernel compile setup (#44)

Prepared separate diagnostic fragment and fail-closed resolved-config check.
Requires implemented providers/UART/initramfs, disables block/storage/network,
USB/display/audio/watchdog and power-policy subsystems. Adds deterministic gzip
Image size/hash reporting without packing firmware. Provider workflow defaults
to this integration mode; resource gate unchanged and reported before starting.
53 local tests pass including rejection of modular storage and missing console.
No configuration/compile success claimed until actual Linux CI resolves/builds
it; stock memory/loader/recovery/logging remain #21, no tablet access occurred.


## 2026-10-25 — Diagnose hidden BLOCK configuration prompt (#44)

Actual run 40183576290 at 14d1b21 failed policy check before Image compilation:
BLOCK resolved y. Pinned block/Kconfig makes its bool prompt conditional on
EXPERT, with default y; generic defconfig has EXPERT=n. Captured source/hash and
failure evidence. Added EXPERT=y, retained strict storage-disabled check, improved
all-mismatch diagnostics and rejected-config logging. Rebuild required; no
kernel/boot result claimed, no tablet access or firmware packing occurred.


## 2026-10-25 — Remove ACPI idle-policy selector (#44)

Second actual run 40184459476 resolves storage disabled but rejects CPU_IDLE=y
before Image compilation. Captured the rejected config from CI stdout and pinned
Kconfig source proving ACPI_PROCESSOR -> ACPI_PROCESSOR_IDLE -> CPU_IDLE. Fragment
now disables ACPI/processor idle policy for the donor-DT experiment; the strict
CPU_IDLE=n gate remains. No ARM_PSCI_FW/DT/stock-loader changes. Corrected build
still pending; no physical tablet access, firmware packing or runtime claim.


## 2026-10-25 — Restricted diagnostic Image compile succeeded (#44)

Actual run 40185547611 at 3bf1010f3f007bd3fd202da30b3483ca12933531 passed
in 23m16s with zero compiler warning/error lines. Resolved strict policy passes;
real clock/pinctrl/power objects W=1 and full Image/vmlinux compiled. Retained
complete resolved config reconstructed from CI and matched original SHA256
f5da34605d2ebc5f279269e59d56027acfefbfb346819d945c7dd7a6c3209eed.

a6ecd7444c9ffc8f47c4954902b23e15fd1f861b924ae9a082157652dc2ab1c1.
Report/log checksum and policy evidence retained. No DT/ramdisk integration,
firmware packing or published test package; stock #21 prerequisites and #27
schema validation remain. No tablet access or runtime result claimed.

## 2026-10-25 — Bounded stock OTA model/boot-image inspection (#46/#21)

Found discovery index HD8/HD10 5.7.1.0 links swapped; verified actual package
identity from CRC-checked properties, rejecting suez/KFSUWI and selecting
candidate douglas/KFDOWI/MT8163 build659664620. Marketing-version/installed-build
match remains unverified (embedded Fire OS property says5.3.7.3). Initial two
metadata probes used204800 bytes; reusable opt-in extractor used8612864 bytes,
within20MiB response-body budget, rather than whole907705758-byte OTA. Boot.img
8689664 bytes / SHA2568982fa50193acc764be69ee51027ee92e83614cee4b8235b07439d1f9e2db363.
Existing inspector confirms2KiB pages/header fields; bounded gzip-prefix check
finds AArch64 magic behind512-byte kernel prefix. Unclassified2KiB trailer and
all signatures remain unverified. Report/ranges/hashes retained, binaries ignored.
59 tests pass with synthetic archives/fake transport. No archive execution,
firmware packing, tablet access or physical change; no test package ready.

## 2026-10-25 — Actual candidate DTB memory/PSCI evidence (#21)

Added bounded local wrapped-gzip/concatenated-DTB inspector. Actual candidate
kernel gzip decompression16584856 bytes; suffix is exactly two DTBs pre_evt/hvt
(82277/82641 bytes), hashes and selected facts retained. Both corroborate static
512MiB memory, legacy explicit-ID PSCI and CPU0 mt-boot, plus all legacy firmware
and log reservations omitted from newer donor. Header reservation maps empty;
body reservations and dynamic CONSYS remain authoritative static declarations,
not runtime measurements. Collector now reads individual DT version property;
only fake transport tests ran. 63 tests pass, including gzip cap/truncation and
invalid wrapper/DT suffix rejection. No downloads, firmware changes, packing or
device access; #21 runtime/loader/log/recovery gates remain open.

## 2026-10-25 — Prepare generic ARM64 VM runtime test (#49)

Added bounded QEMU virt8.2/Cortex-A53/one-CPU/512MiB diagnostic userspace runner,
using existing restricted kernel/initramfs inputs. No disks/network/host shares,
software TCG,120s/2MiB console caps, required init/mount/metadata/idle markers and
5s continued execution; reject panic/read errors/early exit. Dependency installer
requires disposable Linux GitHub runner and <=200MiB APT package archive plan
before install; package versions logged. Existing ACK build resources unchanged.
68 local tests pass, including incomplete/panic/error console rejection and
package gate. Actual VM execution still pending; no douglas boot/hardware/Android
runtime claim. No tablet access, firmware packing or paid provisioning.

## 2026-10-25 — Generic diagnostic execution passed (#49)

Reviewed successful CI 40193403656 at project 2fc0da6d65371783c13bfd800b3a1630f7fa3511,
pinned ACK d9318bdb4c34e8b2d997b4f67ced56b120b22b87. QEMU virt8.2/Cortex-A53
ran restricted kernel plus unchanged diagnostic initramfs: proc/sysfs mounted,
four metadata reads completed, idle survived five seconds. Exact hashes/command,
ARM64 header and CI-log hash retained in evidence/qemu-diagnostic. All routine
checks also passed; 68 tests. Generic execution only; #21 physical loader/memory,
recovery and log qualification remain open. No tablet access or firmware packing.

## 2026-10-25 — Resolve conditional Image placement mismatch (#21)

Compared actual executed Image header with model-verified candidate boot header
and official ARM64 boot ABI. New text_offset=0 requires 2MiB-aligned entry; old
0x40080000 field is misaligned if honored unchanged. Recorded arithmetic and
pinned amonet LK source hashes; payload is not complete loader evidence and
MISC transitions can write persistently. No chosen addresses, firmware assembly,
helpers executed or tablet access. Actual loader relocation remains unresolved.

## 2026-10-25 — Include loader version identifiers in stock facts (#21)

The read-only collector omitted three preloader/LK/TEE version properties used
by pinned amonet step-1.sh. Added only those fixed names and internal Fire OS
version for later installed/candidate matching; serial remains excluded. Fake
transport verifies preservation and no serial query. No real ADB/device access
or helper execution. Property values alone do not authenticate loader binaries.

## 2026-10-25 — Audit diagnostic RAM logging gap (#21/#22)

Resolved config has PSTORE_RAM=m with console/pmsg disabled, while minimal init
cannot load modules. QEMU success is live PL011 output, not retained RAM logs.
Pinned legacy source has a custom multi-stage buffer and optional eMMC write
path; no wholesale logging backport or reservation reuse is justified yet.
Recorded exact hashes and requirements for an isolated backend/retention/reader
or qualified UART path. No config/device changes or helper execution.

## 2026-10-25 — Reject CRLF diagnostic error lines (#49 follow-up)

Found VM verdict parser matched UNAVAILABLE/READ_ERROR only between LF bytes;
serial CRLF translation could bypass that fatal override in an otherwise
complete transcript. Normalize CRLF only for verdict parsing, preserving raw
console bytes and hashes. Regression exercises both errors with LF and CRLF.
No kernel/initramfs/config changes, new heavy build or tablet access.

## 2026-10-25 — Reproducible offline Image placement audit (#21)

Added report-based auditor with cross-report stock hash checks, exact raw/decoded
new header consistency, bounded local JSON input and uint64 arithmetic guards.
Actual old text_offset=0x80000 aligns at the old address; new offset=0 does not.
Retained exact result plus input/auditor hashes. No replacement address selected,
loader behavior authenticated or firmware packed. All 72 tests pass.

## 2026-10-25 — Harden legacy ADB metadata reads (#21/#22)

Classify known remote shell error prefixes as unavailable even when old ADB
returns host status0; do not retain error text. Traverse the device-tree symlink
with a trailing slash and add proc/version for systems without uname. Fake
transport covers status-zero permission/missing-command failures and privacy
filtering. 73 tests pass. Device-specific evidence remains private locally.

## 2026-10-25 — Publish owner-approved sanitized runtime evidence (#21)

Owner explicitly approved sanitized publication. Selected firmware/build/loader
identifiers, runtime DT memory properties and provenance hashes reviewed; no
hardware serial, household data, raw logs or full local report published. Actual
runtime hvt DT reports two banks totaling1430MiB; installed build identity agrees
with inspected OTA candidate, not binary/signature equivalence. PL7/LK3/TEE262
exceed pinned helper6/2/259 maximums. No helper/device operation performed here.

## 2026-10-25 — Decode actual runtime memory handoff (#58)

Implemented strict offline decoder for big-endian DT reg and native little-endian
ARM64 vendor structs; pinned source and compiler layout retained. Actual ranks
total1536MiB, usable reg/mblocks agree at1430MiB, excluding106MiB at top. No
ownership inference or DT enlargement. Five malformed/actual-data test groups
added, all78 tests pass. Next: source-audit excluded/reserved intervals under#21.

## 2026-10-25 — Reservation interval/source audit (#60)

Added reproducible static-vs-runtime inventory and boundary tests. Four fixed
regions total5.3125MiB inside usable banks and have zero overlap with106MiB top
exclusion; dynamic CONSYS location unknown. Pinned memory/ATF/display consumers
identify missing tee/lca/framebuffer runtime fields; accounting equality check
is disabled. No ownership inferred. Exact residual remains#21; next independent
task#27 upstream schema parse/selector failures. All81 tests pass. No device
queries, firmware assembly, helper execution, downloads or paid resources.

## 2026-10-25 — Opt-in corpus YAML lexical repair (#62)

Three Gunyah indentation tabs replaced only in hash-locked opt-in extracted
corpus. Original preserved; no semantic relaxation/suppression. Actual full
context still29errors/57unmatched, passed=false/exit1. YAML parser issue removed,
but schema now explicitly ignored for invalid compatible shape; separate meta
errors retained. All82 tests pass. Next#27 semantic/schema-selector repair.

## 2026-10-25 — Exact PMIC sys-off/domain selection fix (#64)

Opt-in hash-locked generic-domain selector excludes only MT6323 sys-off compatible;
all original domain constraints and MFD binding unchanged. Actual meta-validation
clean; YAML/jsonschema controls preserve missing-cells rejection for real domains
and MFD wrong-compatible/unknown-property rejection. Full-context delta removes
one false domain-cells requirement, adds none:28errors/57unmatched remain.83
unit tests pass. Next#27 remaining schema failures; no device/hardware claims.

## 2026-10-25 — MT8163 sysirq binding coverage (#66)

Pinned ACK/legacy fallback driver evidence retained. Opt-in enum adds MT8163
first compatible requiring unchanged MT6577 fallback; no other constraints
changed. Meta clean; actual processed tuple negative controls reject wrong/
missing/extra fallback. Full delta removes2diagnostics/adds0, now27errors plus
56unmatched, overallfailed.84 tests pass. Next#27 timer or RDMA selector work.

## 2026-10-25 — MT8163 timer binding coverage (#68)

Source-backed exact first-compatible enum proposal requires existing MT6577 GPT
fallback. Pinned ACK/legacy source hashes retained. Meta clean, processed tuple
negative controls reject invalid fallbacks. Actual full delta removes2/adds0:
26errors/55unmatched remain, overallfailed.85 tests pass. Next#27 display-RDMA
node name/generic DMA selector conflict. No tablet access or firmware assembly.

## 2026-10-25 — Display RDMA node-name candidate (#70)

Canonical rdma@ name prevents generic DMA-provider misselection. Compiled alias
path rewrite explicitly checked; other879 property bytes across186nodes unchanged
after reviewed path substitutions. Clean DTC26259B hashc1824152...; CI fourth
variant added. Full delta removes1/adds0:25errors/55unmatched remain.88 tests
pass. No cells invented, schema relaxed, hardware tested or device accessed.
Next#27 RDMA compatible coverage/remaining boot-relevant gaps.

## 2026-10-25 — Storage/UART-DMA compatible coverage (#72)

Pinned ACK fallback evidence retained; two strict opt-in compatible proposals
keep all other constraints. Meta clean; processed controls reject invalid pairs
and preserve existing SoCs. Full delta removes8/adds0:21errors/51unmatched,
overallfailed.89 tests pass. No device/driver/DT/firmware or hardware claim.
Next#27 remaining peripheral fallback or display binding gaps.

## 2026-10-25 — Strict peripheral fallback coverage (#74)

Four opt-in compatible profiles preserve all other constraints; pinned fallback
drivers/source hashes retained. Meta clean, processed controls pass. Actual full
delta removes12/adds0:15errors/45unmatched remain, overallfailed.90 tests pass.
No bus/ADC/RNG hardware/security qualification. Next#21 cached loader/recovery
alternative audit to advance the physical diagnostic boot blocker.

## 2026-10-25 — Loader/recovery alternatives audit (#76)

Source/hash/line inventory distinguishes stock recovery, handshake, old software
unlock, BootROM chain, newer preloader exploit and post-unlock custom loaders.
Newer fork has explicit douglas target but requires older vulnerable preloader;
old minimal chain still modifies GPT/RPMB/preloader/boot. No qualified safe route
yet. Offline assessor and3tests added;93tests pass. Next bounded OTA preloader/LK
static inspection planned383684compressed bytes plus metadata, no fullOTA.
No helper/payload compiled/executed, reference modified or tablet accessed.

## 2026-10-25 — Bounded build-matched loader inspection (#78)

Explicit loader whitelist/model/build gate,2MiB transport body cap,1MiB entries
and capped static marker/header reports added. Actual452322B fetched; preloader
139352B/LK485552B hashes retained, binaries ignored/notexecuted. Heuristic marker
absent; exploitability remains unknown. LK wrapper485040B payload equals file
minus512.98 tests pass. Next#21 static entry/format audit, no tablet operations.

## 2026-10-25 — Exact loader container/address audit (#80)

GFH declaration gives preloader code view0x201000..0x222c34; LK prefix uses default
address sentinel, so old4bd00000base is unverified. Strict hash/bounds parser and
source-based hypothetical patch windows retained with compatibility=false. Old
helper donor binaries absent in pinned git.102 tests pass. Next#21 stock LK
control-flow analysis using existing LLVM, no new dependency or device operation.

## 2026-10-25 — Actual LK K64/secure-monitor instruction trace (#82)

Startup instructions substantiate linked4bd00000base. Checked Thumb chain passes
entry-slot/current-r5/0/1 through K64-labelled wrapper to ARM SMC#0 service82000200.
Exact offsets/bytes, PC-relative references, disassembly and hashes retained.
r5 lineage, upstream header/decompression producer and monitor behavior remain
unverified. Non-loadable static-analysis object only;106 tests pass. Next#21
trace entry-slot producer. No code/firmware execution, new download or tablet IO.

## 2026-10-25 — Header entry/decompression producer (#84)

Exact cached LK static trace joins three GOT references to header-pointer global
4bd841b0. Selected header+0xc supplies entry and gzip output; K64 checks512KiB
alignment and loops on failure; decompression call supplies28MiB capacity. Modern
diagnostic image_size equals that capacity (no margin, not success/failure proof).
Selected bytes/disassembly/hashes and mutation negative controls retained. No
firmware execution, downloads or tablet IO. Next: staging/input length and DT
handling before considering any test package; recovery remains unqualified.

## 2026-10-25 — Selected LK compressed input/DT sizing (#86)

Retained exact LK instruction windows connect staging45000000, prefix-present
read adjustment-512, backward FDT scan/suffix rounding and separate inflate
input/output lengths. Conditional stock DT-match arithmetic retained without
claiming actual selection. Stock gzip output16584856 leaves12775272 of28MiB
capacity. Clarified image_size is runtime memory requirement, not decoded file
length; modern actual byte length remains unmeasured here. No device/firmware
execution/download. Next: measure cached modern Image output versus reserved
runtime footprint; recovery and physical boot remain unqualified.

## 2026-10-25 — Exact keypad fallback schema coverage (#90)

While PR89's generic compile runs, independently validated cached donor keypad
fallback against pinned ACK driver/schema. Added opt-in single-enum binding
proposal with hashes and six processed-schema positive/negative controls.
Full-corpus diagnostic count60→58 (14validation/44unmatched), zero new diagnostics;
overall still fails, as expected.113 offline tests pass on this branch (PR89
measurement tests remain on that separate pending branch). No hardware DT/node
status change, device access or hardware claims. Parent27 remains open; next
independent binding candidate is efuse fallback coverage after source inspection.
## 2026-10-25 — Actual modern Image length evidence (#88)

Recovered original generic run40193403656 size/hash lines from1.47MB CI log:
Image28576256bytes, gzip9187924bytes, rawSHA08df8a73166bf5bd3a0fefdd9394d8f5d54b2822255e728c2c3873f2e1c56909.
Raw file fits selected28MiB output capacity with783872bytes margin; declared
runtime image_size is separately28MiB. Historical binaries remain absent, so no
new historical gzip round trip claimed. Added bounded single-member measurement
and exact Image comparison to existing diagnostic build/VM reports;115 offline
tests pass. Integration CI uses existing reported kernel resource gate. No tablet
IO, firmware assembly or physical destination. Recovery/entry alignment and
secure-monitor qualification still block a user test package.

## 2026-10-25 — Measurement integration validated; ordered PR merges

PR89 headb1f3c1fc2652f249db744f8997021ea7d7649fdb passed all required checks and
actual compile/QEMU run40250576526 (24m2s CI job). New rawSHA16c9e5e6947231070888dcba5467b79df20ef6eee060edd86b36ec6fd336bcb3,
28576256bytes; gzip9187928bytes, round trip verified; capacity margin783872bytes.
QEMU markers/read-only proc/sysfs reads and5s idle passed in5.94s. Retained exact
report plus full1.47MB log hash in evidence/image-measurements/validated-runtime-result.json.
Build hash differs from historical output; no bit-identical rebuild claim.
PR89 merged; issue88 closed. Merged development into keypad PR91, explicitly
preserving both appended WORKLOG sections, then added this validation evidence.
Tablet boot/hardware/app stages remain untested. Next merge91 after refreshed
required checks; independent efuse scope92 remains queued.

## 2026-10-25 — Generic efuse compatible and calibration constraints (#92)

Audited cached pinned ACK generic efuse driver against donor calibration cell.
Generic match has no MT8186 speedbin postprocessing; legacy fixed cells enabled.
Added opt-in exact tuple proposal preserving all other constraints. Nine actual
processed-schema controls pass; full-corpus diagnostics58→56 (13validation and
43unmatched), zero additions. Overall validation remains failed/exit1;117 offline
tests pass. Source/patch/schema hashes and complete delta retained. No calibration
correctness, efuse IO or hardware support claimed. Parent27 remains open. Next:
return to21's secure-monitor/CPU handoff source contract before more display work.

## 2026-10-25 — CPU startup / monitor source contract (#94)

Compared cached legacy mt-boot/PSCI and ACK CPU ops plus stock/donor DT contracts.
Legacy wrapper adds host-side MTCMOS power sequencing after PSCI; ACK DT table
has no mt-boot method. ACK still supports explicit legacy PSCI IDs, so old DT
format alone is not a hard blocker. Donor v0.2 ARM64 CPU_ON C4000003 differs from
stock explicit84000003; monitor acceptance remains unknown. LK primary82000200
is separate. Source hashes/line anchors and mutation controls retained. Legacy
reference not binary-matched to stock. Proposed primary-only diagnostic limit
requires boot-CPU path audit; no device/SMC/firmware execution. Next bounded task:
trace boot-CPU versus secondary setup and maxcpus=1 effects before choosing DT
CPU changes. Physical recovery/logging and hardware/runtime gates remain open.

## 2026-10-25 — Isolated primary-only DT/source experiment (#96)

Traced pinned setup_arch early parsing→PSCI discovery→boot-CPU ops/enumeration.
maxcpus=1 alone still probes PSCI and prepares secondaries. Added opt-in compiled
DT-only experiment: PSCI node disabled, chosen nr_cpus=1 maxcpus=0; preserves all
186nodes/880original properties and default experiments. Compiles cleanly to
26324bytes/SHAef23af15f7136613a98b450f3d1db7c860f581024d194e88e2ef8c3116f2eb43.
Source/hash guards and full semantic comparison/negative controls retained.
Loader preservation, boot MPIDR, other firmware paths, donor RAM and physical
boot remain unverified. No firmware packing/device/SMC/helper execution. Next:
trace actual LK bootargs rewriting before treating the limits as effective.

## 2026-10-25 — Actual LK chosen/bootargs replacement trace (#98)

Exact cached LK static trace connects file-backed command buffer4bd74cb8 and
header+40 format input to selected FDT bootargs write. Writer usesstrlen+1,
resizes existing property, sets new length and copies new buffer; DT bootargs
alone are not a preservation guarantee. Initial static150-byte buffer lacks
diagnostic limits; runtime mutations/all boot modes remain unqualified. Retained
instruction/call/string/hash evidence plus126 passing offline tests and mutation/
argument negative controls. No PSCI-status preservation or physical boot claim,
firmware/helper execution or tablet IO. Next: sanitized effective command-line/
CPU-count diagnostic reporting, keeping loader/recovery/logging gates open.

## 2026-10-25 — GCE fallback binding coverage (#102)

While PR101 actual init/kernel VM validation runs, audited pinned GCE fallback
pdata and cached legacy thread-count/security definitions. Added opt-in exact
MT8163/MT8173 tuple coverage preserving other schema constraints. Seven actual
processed-schema controls pass; full-corpus diagnostics56→54 (12validation and
42unmatched), zero additions; overall still fails/exit1.127 offline tests pass
on this independent branch; PR101's parser/runtime changes remain separate.
Source hashes/delta retained. No CMDQ execution, DT/hardware enablement or device
access. Merge after PR101 to avoid invalidating its expensive compile head, then
reconcile appended WORKLOG and rerun inexpensive required checks.
## 2026-10-25 — Sanitized CPU-contract init reporting (#100, runtime pending)

Implemented bounded private cmdline/CPU-online/live-DT status reads in minimal
init with allowlisted verdict-only output. Added shared C parsers exercised by
native host tests and distinct generic-observer/primary-contract evidence checks.
130offline tests and local AArch64 object compile with Werror pass. Builder
records header/source hashes; linked initramfs and generic VM integration remain
pending existing gated CI. No raw private argument emission, tablet/device access
or firmware assembly. Do not close100 until actual init/runtime integration is
validated. Recovery, usable physical logging and loader contract remain open.

## 2026-10-25 — Actual sanitized CPU init integration passed

PR101 head84c0392393eacf9dfef2b1d4e6b17d6bcc9c017b passed compile/initramfs/QEMU
run40259254917 in23m55s. Actual verdicts: both limits missing (expected generic
command line), one online CPU/CPU0 alone, PSCI status unavailable. Generic
observation passes; primary-only contract remains false. Retained exact runtime
report/artifact/log hashes in evidence/sanitized-cpu-report/generic-runtime-result.json.
PR101 merged/100 closed. Reconciled GCE PR103 against development preserving both
WORKLOG sections. Recovery work104 has started: declared PL7 mapping places an
old USB-descriptor patch address in a referenced string-literal pool and another
old entry in an interior block; exact trace/evidence is being prepared separately.
No tablet/helper/firmware execution or hardware qualification.

## 2026-10-25 — Recoverable loading priority / exact PL7 code (#104)

Prioritized recovery over more schema cleanup. Exact cached PL7/GFH mapping shows
old USB patch site217420 is a referenced string-literal word; old DA/TEE entry
sites lie in selected interior blocks. ARB entry201934 corroborated by diagnostic
strings and conditional caller20a7ce, not complete policy/compatibility. Retained
bounded static bytes/disassembly/hash/call controls;134 offline tests pass.
No replacement patches/payloads, helper/firmware execution, tablet IO or downgrade.
Compatible load/restore route remains unqualified. Next recovery task: qualify
older reference preloader/restore-material provenance and precise entry/restore
prerequisites rather than reuse stale offsets or infer exploitability from a
marker.100/102 completed with actual generic VM evidence and required checks;
physical boot/recovery/hardware/app gates remain open.

## 2026-10-25 — Reference material located, recovery not qualified (#106)

Located pinned mirror22.3MB archive; fetched only519984response bytes using strict
ranges. Older preloader138924B/SHAcefc66528a56626e65a553b7f97e0521e7939c195ce72794e7c4e14eab04619d
and LK485988B hashes retained; binaries ignored. Original author/Amazon-build
identity unverified (XDA403). Minimal mode still changes persistent GPT/boot0/
RPMB/boot/recovery/MISC; complete escrow/restore not established. Added bounded
probe and hash-only comparison;138offline tests pass. Approval review rejected
publication of copied helper code; removed it and raw code windows from public
changes, keeping only nonoperational summaries/metadata/hashes.106 remains open;
next official older OTA/original attachment match plus entry/restore validation.
No tablet/helper/firmware execution or physical changes.

## 2026-10-25 — Official-hosted older component provenance matched (#106)

Initial659658220 Amazon URL denied HEAD; retained status observations, no body.
Located other pinned index records and probed actual Amazon-hosted build metadata
before capped loader extraction.636558520 preloader+LK match older mirror hashes;
657611720 retains older preloader/current LK;659662320 has same PL/LK as current.
Read1356647body bytes total across three probes, no full~900MB OTA. Public reports
contain properties/metadata/digests/range hashes only, no helper/firmware code.
Added offline host/model/resource/digest verifier;141tests pass. Component source
provenance resolved, not signatures/antirollback/helper authenticity or restore.
106 remains open; next separate safe entry/backup escrow from persistent writes.
No tablet/helper/firmware execution, downgrade, flashing or device changes.

## 2026-10-25 — Recovery entry/escrow source audit (#106)

Merged PR108 after exact-head required checks passed (reran stale validation
job); development base03da5d38e477fc79ca7506512bc3d3dcb7191b34. Added AST-only
source audit and two regression tests:143 offline tests pass. Old minimal route
is not backup-first; conditional early writes and dropped size bound recorded.
Located pinned MTKClient MT8163/douglas configuration and Mac documentation as
a possible independent read-back alternative. Read APIs alone do not qualify
bootstrap/indirect persistence behavior; duplicate GPT filenames reuse data.
Retained source hashes/line summaries only, with helpers ignored locally.
No payload/dependency install, helper execution, tablet access or firmware changes.
106 remains open: next audit legacy DA/bootstrap side effects and minimal Mac
CLI requirements, then independent escrow/restore/log qualification.

## 2026-10-25 — Legacy backup selection/bootstrap audit (#106)

PR109 merged only after all four exact-head required checks passed; new base
102cb12 (full revision available in Git). Read111117B across six pinned source
files, no payloads or installs. Added source-hash-checked AST method closure and
regression tests:145 offline tests pass. Legacy upload/read closures do not
reach named write/format methods, but external protocol/agents remain unaudited.
Found a concrete escrow failure path: readflash ignores failed partition-select
acknowledgement and can proceed against an unconfirmed region. Dynamic DA mode
can override the configured legacy choice. FUSE imports have guarded fallbacks;
complete minimal Mac CLI import closure remains unverified. No tablet access.
106 stays open. Next offline deliverable: fail-closed escrow geometry/hash/GPT
validation with synthetic fixtures; safe entry, restoration and usable physical
boot-log capture still unqualified.

## 2026-10-26 — Offline escrow verifier (#106)

Merged PR110 exact head02df4b85ab6e8c5f0d69147b535448ef3a79443d after all four
required checks passed; basea8940c6. Implemented regular-file-only three-region
length/SHA verification plus GPT headers/arrays from actual primary/final-LBA
locations, CRCs, reciprocal geometry, partition bounds/overlap and consistency.
Caps metadata memory; no device protocols or restore actions. Seven synthetic
tests bring suite to152 passing, repository guard/diff check pass. Qualification
flags stay false even on valid files: collection region identity, restoration
and physical-test readiness are not established by checksums. UEFI2.11chapter5

ELF/BSS size input; 1576 already aligned leaves the linked 24-byte zero tail
unprovided by alignment. Insecure DA signature padding is not initialization

## 2026-10-27 — Actual two-base failure and marker fix (#311 / #312)

Run40470154989/job122075066145 failed comparison at head
41fb9974b93df73a608eb54e63cc9431060575f2; #312 notmerged. Separate local marker
object revealed3ABS32 pointertable relocations; linkedELFsection absence had not
proved baseindependence. Replaced switchpointerselection with fixedstride chars/
scalar lengths. Actual local ARM recompilation shows0ABS32 markerentries;
290hosttests pass. Retained failure/object/source metadata; Linuxconfirmation
pending. Repo/diff pass. No firmware/device execution. Next exacthead CI both
variants, no weakened comparison or runtime/restore claim.

## 2026-10-27 — Corrected Linux two-base result (#311 / #312)

Actual Linux job 40471752722/122080264532 passed at source head
`722f52846a9e1aafba65206c82f291af115fdceb`, tested merge
`0c7a7b78b76dfcc5f15102046e82322b5f1a3644`. Direct (3000 bytes) and bridge
(3040 bytes) have equal normalized load bytes at zero and synthetic `0x10000000`,
with unchanged relative entry and ARM/Thumb state. Exact image/source hashes,
tool versions and stack analysis are retained in
`evidence/owned-agent-link-bases/report.json`. This confirms the pointer-table
fix for these two linked bases; it does not prove arbitrary runtime relocation,
physical mapping, callback binding, security entry, original-state restoration
or captured UART output. No firmware or tablet execution occurred.

Next: original acquisition/restore provenance and board-specific logging
qualification under #106; existing board-record question remains pending.

## 2026-10-27 — Offline fixed-marker transcript reader (#313)

After #312 merged as 926a8aefe592e97b03e27a4498251ce40393000a, added a regular
host-file-only, 1 MiB capped reader for exact complete ENTRY/RETURN or ENTRY/ERROR
lines. Rejects ambiguous sequence qualification and never echoes raw transcript.
Three tests cover valid pairs, privacy, partial/reordered/repeated/corrupted markers
and the size cap; full 293 host tests pass. No physical acquisition, serial port,
helper or firmware execution. Next board-specific acquisition and restore
provenance remain open under #106; existing board-record question pending.

## 2026-10-27 — Source-level writable restore prerequisites (#315)

At cached kernel e0a3a2b2378ae4c7494ffdfea34d2a9e04a5fb74, inspected exact git
objects for MMC block/core/header definitions. Retained whole-source SHA256 and
reviewed ranges in evidence/restore-write-protection/report.json. Host force_ro is
not a card unlock; power-lock setter can return input count despite logged switch
failure; cached partition selection is not independent readback, and initial
user selection tolerates EBADMSG. Matching backup bytes therefore leave writable
post-failure restoration unqualified. No device/sysfs/helper/firmware operation.
Next actual board/capture/restore provenance under #106; existing question pending.

## 2026-10-27 — Retained-console source route (#317)

Inspected cached kernel e0a3a2b2378ae4c7494ffdfea34d2a9e04a5fb74 exact git objects:
ARM64 douglas config enables DRAM MTK RAM console; old-buffer copy and conditional
last_kmsg late-init form a possible retrieval chain. Stored source hashes/ranges.
Signature/size reset, allocation, conditional pstore branches and raw fallback
prevent treating this as proven retention or sanitized first-byte logs. No installed
binary match, cross-boot observation or device acquisition. Next actual config,
layout/retention and accessible recovery retrieval remain open under #106.

## 2026-10-27 — Exact stock ramdisk log-access policy (#321)

Inspected existing boot SHA8982fa50193acc764be69ee51027ee92e83614cee4b8235b07439d1f9e2db363
using component bounds, capped gzip and newc parsing only. Ramdisk 1492335 bytes;
decoded archive 2917376 bytes. Metadata receipt preserves hashes/line ranges.
Packaged init declares restricted pstore/last_kmsg and private copy permissions;
douglas init declares removing the copy. Actual action ordering/access/log survival
unverified. No raw upstream files/logs published and no execution/device access.
Next lifecycle and authorized retrieval evidence, independent of retained-memory
qualification. Repository/diff checks applied; no code changed.

## 2026-10-27 — Central recovery handoff (#324)

Corrected the checklist's stale 3024/3072-byte pre-marker-fix image reference to
explicitly supersede it with #312's 3000/3040-byte two-base receipt. Consolidated
source evidence and missing configuration, memory/retention, writable restore,
retrieval and board/UART prerequisites through #323. Existing owner board-record
question remains pending; no new physical request. No runtime gate closed.
Documentation-only repository/diff checks; next evidence provenance before any
concrete physical proposal, not additional marker/count work.

## 2026-10-27 — Owner board-record answer

Owner confirms no existing internal-board photos or PCB revision records. Removed
pending-question dependency from current hardware plan/checklist. Hardware planning
remains allowed, but no specific physical action is qualified/authorized. Next
source-qualify exact-generation mechanical/isolation evidence for a reviewable
inspection proposal; do not wait for absent photos or repeat the question. No
physical/runtime gate closed. Documentation repository/diff checks only.

## 2026-10-27 — Epic/Feature/Phase/Task beta delivery baseline (#343)

Reparented existing open scopes without closing hardware/runtime gates; created
concrete recovery, platform and QA admission phases/tasks. Added both boards'
Level/Delivery state fields and a Beta1 QA-admission milestone without invented
dates. Historical closed cards are reversibly archived, issues retained. Published
projects/delivery-plan.json and roadmap/workflow. Every PR now requires a real
Updates/Refs/Closes issue reference; parser rejection tests cover template examples,
missing issues and PR substitutions. Existing open PR descriptions linked to issues.
Main release policy remains unchanged. No device action or runtime pass.

Verified all41 native hierarchy nodes/parents; both boards now expose hierarchy,
phase gates, ready tasks and blocked tasks. Archived137 historical closed cards.
PR linkage check passed in actual GitHub run40525664117; added it to development
and main required checks, preserving strict mode and existing contexts. Issue forms
and checked-in taxonomy now support Epic/Feature/Phase/Task. All runtime gates stay
open; no beta date fabricated. Source audit history and linked PRs remain accessible.

Added phase352/tasks353–354 for the existing first-party license hold and exact
beta redistribution/source-obligation review. These are blocked policy inputs,
not permissions inferred from CI. Total current delivery map44 nodes; Android
and optional Crestron QA gates remain separate.

## 2026-10-27 — Cover-only inspection review proposal (#345)

Prepared a concrete review artifact in HARDWARE-EVIDENCE-PLAN.md using the
firsthand exact-generation cover account and actually viewed supplier frames.
Explicitly records video identity conflict, unknown connector mechanics and
energized-battery boundary. Scope is identification-only with observable stop
conditions/privacy handling; no physical action is approved. Updates345, not
closure: owner/operator review and exact mechanical safety remain unresolved.
Next independent work339 QA matrix while review/source gaps are pending. CI/PRs
inspected healthy; no device/helper/firmware action or new audit micro-issue.

## 2026-10-27 — Beta QA test definition (#339)

Defined admissionA01–A07 versus campaignQ01–Q04, recovery/log/memory-first
preconditions, proposed measured smoke thresholds, stop conditions, result format
and S0–S3 defect triage. All device cases NOT RUN. No test execution or physical
procedure authorized. Inspection345 remains pending review; matrix is independent
planned work under phase338, not a new micro-issue. Phase/beta admission remains
open. Documentation community/repository/diff checks applied.

## 2026-10-27 — Original douglas route and full/minimal correction (#347)

Broader search reached original XDA via browser despite text-fetch502. Read author
post80154797, maintainer90487831/90490714 and fallback90488396; recent failure
reports corroborate wrong brick/minimal pairing. Static full launcher inspection:
54bytes, SHA c7c93a2aff2b17bb2cd9fd1a90fcea7ac22699986f14c445d434668e56126799;
65557 response bytes within128KiB cap. Cached main non-minimal guards corroborated;
no upstream code copied publicly or helper executed. USB-first candidate now gets
priority, cover review is fallback. Exact-build execution/restore/log gates remain
open. Owner Linux host available (private alias excluded); second desk tablet is
Fire7, generation unknown and outside douglas route. Next original-package match
and full-stage write/restore inventory, not more case-only audit waiting.

## 2026-10-27 — Full-stage write/escrow boundary (#347/#346)

Static AST/range review of cached main SHA0fc1e6b2455503c98ccfd5954174f701e6b2011f85f30d6aa5e40ee842df13d5
found zero dump_binary calls in main and GPT writes before later region/security
checks. Retained full/shared write stages and readback limitations; no atomic
rollback or exhaustive imported-helper claim. Explicit preservation decision
required before any destructive test; Linux availability is not permission.
No device/helper execution. Existing tasks updated; no audit micro-issue created.

## 2026-10-27 — reconcile recovery route and host prerequisites (#347)

- Source baseline b51c24f1655a18890fb5422c09716aad21dab373; latest three CI
  runs successful, open PR11 is the dependency update.
- Corrected the main recovery plan's stale read-back-first and native-Mac
  prerequisites to the current original-author USB-first candidate and verified
  Linux tool inventory. USB transport, exact-build entry, restore and logs remain
  untested; no tablet, helper, service or firmware operation occurred.
- Owner approved original archives under a combined 31 MiB cap. Browser retrieval
  timed out, attachment navigation was blocked by client, and no archive was
  found in the approved output/download/temp locations checked. Approval is no
  longer the blocker. Next: original package identity and preservation decision;
  do not treat cached mirror hashes as original attachment verification.

## 2026-10-27 — stock-return reachability audit (#346 / #347)

- PR359 passed all five checks and merged to development.
- Read cached return-to-stock.sh and functions.inc at Git revision
  2d8a4e6f73d9dab42d313c9cd751802b23ea7d31 using nl/rg and SHA256; no
  source/import/helper execution. Retained metadata-only source receipt.
- Found ADB/root dependency, unbounded root fallback, reconstruction from current
  GPT rather than complete original escrow, and no selected-script post-write
  readback. Reboot request is not observed recovery. Original ZIP identity and
  independent failure-return remain unresolved. No tablet access occurred.

## 2026-10-27 — GPT return preservation boundary (#346)

- Baseline63d946a742d0ff1d44f9c857925755bdbbe9fceb after PR360 merged with
  all five exact-head checks successful.
- Read pinned modules/gpt.py ranges82–112,147–174,222–240,271–273,305–318;
  SHA256bef85112cecc80a96b72d47688ebd90951524c923a2ad74d9fbb7d92fd7c8fa7.
  No vendor code imported/executed. Metadata receipt records reconstruction
  assumptions, compacted empty slots and lack of original-sector comparison.
- Approved original attachment normal GET: curl --fail --location --max-time30
  --max-filesize19000000 to ignored out/recovery-originals: HTTP403, no saved
  ZIP. Browser/client bypass not attempted. Next original archive acquisition
  and independently reachable restore; no hardware/runtime gate closed.

## 2026-10-27 — offline original-archive intake (#347)

- Baseline7ab0e8de7f264729f028c1af8f868596fe157968 after PR361 passed all
  five exact-head checks and merged. Original archive directory remains empty.
- Added owned scripts/inspect_recovery_originals.py: local files only, combined
  31MiB cap, selected-content limits, SHA256/receipt comparison, missing entries
  and unverified origin/restore flags. No extraction, helper import or execution.
- Script SHA256: 8e3b67da0e91aabb518201f0f832e9069ed8e325019e9085e65d8b4b56064034.
- python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -q:299 tests passed, including hostile
  path/canonical duplication, compressed oversized selected entry, input symlink,
  combined budget and synthetic identity/non-execution cases. Repository guard
  against the exact baseline and git diff --check passed. Real originals remain
  unavailable; next run intake and original provenance review when supplied.

## 2026-10-27 — packaged retained-log lifecycle (#348)

- Reparsed cached stock boot SHA2568982fa50193acc764be69ee51027ee92e83614cee4b8235b07439d1f9e2db363;
  bounded gzip/newc walk under16MiB, decoded cpio2,917,376bytes. Own inspection
  command retained at ignored out/stock-log-lifecycle/inspect.py and report.json.
- Matched packaged file hashes to prior stock-log-access receipt. Assigned each
  declaration to its actual on-trigger: removal post-fs, copy post-fs-data.
  Traced packaged import declarations; no runtime property/event order inferred.
- New sanitized lifecycle receipt records hashes/ranges and all runtime flags
  false. No ramdisk execution, helper execution, raw log read or tablet access.
  Next exact backend/retention/access evidence; physical task348 remains open.

## 2026-10-27 — retained-console reservation proof (#348)

- Inspected pinned legacy generic FDT reservation and ram-console callback paths;
  verified the five inspected files have no working-tree diff despite unrelated
  preexisting case-collision changes elsewhere. Exact source hashes/ranges in
  evidence/retained-console-route/reservation-path.json.
- Fixed-reg first node remains saved on reservation failure; logging-only console
  callback can return success later. Callback/init banners cannot independently
  prove successful reservation. No runtime failure inferred or gate closed.
- Prior static config/candidate-region comparison receipt retained privately at
  out/stock-log-config/reservation-crosscheck.json. Original archives still absent.
  Next actual reservation/retention evidence and original package verification;
  no helper/firmware/device execution or source-tree mutation occurred.

## 2026-10-27 — offline legacy-console ring decoder (#348)

- Baselinefd5af92 after PR364 merged with all five exact-head checks passed.
- Reviewed legacy header/writer/reader layout at pinned sourcee0a3a2b2378ae4c7494ffdfea34d2a9e04a5fb74,
  ram-console source SHA256cc57dd6936a85f40fb59ded3ee45f66db7ee9dc6dbc415b1c4049591ac66779e;
  lines98–119,300–340,464–472. No upstream code imported/executed/modified.
- Added owned bounded host-file decoder with chronological hashes and no raw log
  output. Rejects counter underflow, invalid partial cursor and corrupt bounds.
  Origin/freshness/layout/retention/boot flags remain false; synthetic data only.
  Decoder SHA25673e002fd34b003bbd29420a958d356671c90323b573ce3dae6203391d1d48fab.
- python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -q:302 pass; repository guard against
  current development and whitespace check pass. Next approved supplied legacy
  buffers, not live acquisition; original ZIP intake remains blocked on files.

## 2026-10-27 — original package restore review (#347 / #346)

- Base0cd1594 current development; open dependency PR11 only, latest CI healthy.
- Original post attachments acquired through normal Chrome clicks, combined
  31,461,609bytes within approved31MiB cap; ignored ZIPs preserved locally.
  All eight prior selected mirror comparisons equal; launcher and cached
  functions/GPT/return script hashes match. No archive helper import/execution.
- Ran owned inspect_recovery_originals.py with pinned mirror receipt; streamed
  all non-directory entries through SHA256/ZIP CRC with128MiB per-entry and
  300MiB aggregate local caps (actual272,362,922bytes),1MiB chunks. Own
  inspect_boot_image.inspect parsed supplied recovery/TWRP bytes without execution.
  Exact hashes/layout/source URLs in original-package-review.json.
- Reviewed original launchers, main/common/load_payload and return dependencies.
  Found stale minimal-stage continuation, discarded write-size bound and
  unacknowledged selector method; opaque payload effects remain unproved.
- Original return package is recovery+script only, not full-state rollback.
  Packaged recovery kernel differs from current-stock boot kernel. Recorded
  reviewable effects, failure stop boundaries and remaining owner/physical gates.
  Next actual write geometry/binary and independent return/log qualification;
  no tablet/firmware/helper action occurred.

## 2026-10-27 — original write geometry and failure boundaries (#347 / #346)

- Baseline5c5f23c8dfd2a05de2aa4f4bfaccd4e260c500a5; no new feature PRs pending.
- Added owned pinned-metadata arithmetic audit. Selected boot0 extents disjoint;
  declared0x37000-sector exploit slots fit header/payload with560,640bytes slack.
  Actual GPT/target geometry still unknown; source helper's dropped bound remains.
- Sanitized internal-only block sizes from already authorized cached report
  SHA256f8521045dd891c20ea01a4baec9a3117edf6035a801b865fa2aeab5d8fe8f79a.
  No SD/household/device identifiers published. Kernel-reported sizes are not
  independently acquired EXT_CSD or GPT-name/address proof.
- Read cached native selector/RPMB dispatch source; exact hashes/ranges retained.
  Selector prints status without framed host acknowledgement. Shipped native
  binary/source equivalence unverified; no build/import/execution.
- Recorded pre-mutation, cleared-header, changed GPT/security and restored-header
  failure boundaries. No independent physical exit or original-state rollback
  demonstrated. Next exact selection/geometry and reachable return/log evidence.
- Validation:304 host tests pass; community/link, repository guard against exact
  baseline and staged whitespace checks pass. No runtime test was performed.

## 2026-10-27 — source-qualified minimal partition metadata (#347)

- CI healthy, open dependency PR11 only. Located cached proc partinfo source at
  pinnede0a3a2b2378ae4c7494ffdfea34d2a9e04a5fb74. Read-only0444 file reports
  names/start/size; source synthetic pgpt/sgpt rows are not raw backup GPT proof.
- Added partinfo to existing owner-run bounded metadata collector; no live run.
  Injected reader test covers available output and legacy zero-exit denial,
  absence of raw block reads or su fallback. Source receipt retains hashes/ranges.
- Prepared exact targeted read for separate owner review; actual availability and
  permission still unverified. Next approved supplied layout record, not another
  automatic device query. No tablet/helper/firmware activity occurred.

## 2026-10-27 — owner-approved named layout evidence (#347 / #346)

- Owner connected douglas, added plugdev membership, installed a narrow USB-mode
  rule and authorized the ADB host. Agent restarted only the account-owned host
  ADB server to clear cached permission state; no tablet reboot occurred.
- Authorized targeted property reads confirmed Amazon/KFDOWI/douglas.
  proc partinfo missing:64-byte error SHA256f33c257060bb942bb0298adb5b2aa67591e22a869092a04fbcec279e979e4b11.
- Read only sysfs mmcblk0 partition start/size/uevent metadata using a fixed shell
  loop, no root or block-device reads. Private2258-byte capture SHA256
  8bb1c0b3f59f89de6741c8069cdb9b83d8c9abf9f22668d9d8dbf20183f4a398.
  Published only normalized internal partition fields, no serial/host/household data.
- Offline assertions:16 unique consecutive-numbered/nonoverlapping named ranges;
  original LK/TEE/TWRP/recovery sizes fit reported capacities. Large-offset exploit
  payload does not fit original boot/recovery. Conditional source GPT projection
  shrinks userdata231,194,112bytes; no storage changed. Raw GPT/security escrow,
  selector and reachable failure-return/log qualification remain open.
- Baseline8d0a520d7cd102e1e971590690ad3c3635b4c9d9. Next independent failure
  return/logging with explicit preservation limits; automatic tablet access remains
  prohibited even while connected.

## 2026-10-27 — actual restore/log accessibility (#346 / #348)

- Owner requested restore and log qualification after named-layout capture.
  Verified douglas identity, current659664620/PL7/LK3/TEE262 via targeted properties.
- Read only shell identity, permission metadata, user sysfs capacity, bounded
  current dmesg attempt and exact SYSTEM_LAST_KMSG diagnostic archive metadata.
  No raw blocks, protected copied log contents, root, reboot or helper execution.
- dmesg denied; last_kmsg metadata denied; pstore/config.gz missing. Copied log
  exists0600/system but was not read. Tag-filtered archive query returned no entries.
  Exact sanitized receipts in observed-restore-log-access.json; raw outputs ignored.
- Downloaded32133-byte official AOSP5.1.1 DropBoxManagerService source to inspect
  tag filtering/DUMP gate before targeted query; no broad bugreport or app logs.
- Asked preservation requirement for current unit as a planning decision only:
  expendable/wipe/security changes versus preserve current data/state. Next target
  determines restore acceptance; no consent to firmware execution inferred.
  Both branches still require credible failure exit and independent log path.

- Owner replied wiped test unit acceptable. Updated current acceptance target:
  supported-stock return and independent logs; original-state preservation no
  longer required for this unit. Planning only, no execution approval inferred.
- Inspected exact-build OTA updater-script/ota.prop/system-devicepath via strict
  ETag/size-pinned ranges,512KiB cap,66,411bytes actual. Full OTA907,705,758bytes
  remains undownloaded/unauthenticated; selected script writes system,boot,LK,TEE
  and preloader aliases but does not explicitly restore recovery/RPMB. No updater
  binary execution. Next full-package resource gate and independent failure/log path.

## 2026-10-27 — approved full stock OTA verification (#346)

- Owner explicitly approved full866MiB stock download. Streamed exact907,705,758-
  byte Amazon object under910,000,000 cap, checked pinned ETag/status/encoding,
  saved ignored stock-return file; SHA2566e70792b002d5274286a8cd7e66da4b80e748a545b3303ab466795548d00f9ab.
- Parsed OTA footer/EOCD with duplicate-marker rejection. Detached DER1553bytes,
  signed prefix907,704,179bytes. OpenSSL4.1.0 CMS -verify -binary -inform DER
  -content /dev/stdin -noverify:success; no PKI trust inferred. Stream-only one-byte
  mutation correctly failed(exit4); original file unchanged. Own scripts and exact
  local receipts under ignored out/stock-return/signature/.
- Compared original return-recovery res/keys material to embedded signer:
  modulus/exponent3 and SHA1 profile match, n0inv/RR consistent. Bounded16MiB
  gzip/newc read; no image code execution. Candidate/installed trust kept distinct.
- Primary AOSP verifier source fetched at exact ec63d564a86ad5b30f75aa307b4bd271f6a96a56
  after a requested historical mirror URL returned404;11,291source bytes, retained
  hash/ranges. No binary/helper run or tablet access. Next recovery acceptance,
  failure entry/return and independent logs; task346 remains open.

## 2026-10-27 — cached exact-build recovery reconstruction (#346)

- CI healthy; dependency PR11 only. Owner stock-recovery entry/return approval
  remains pending; no device/USB query or reboot during this automatic run.
- Verified9 target-blocklist component hashes/lengths by bounded local streaming;
 1,543,191,816unique bytes under2GiB cap, no new downloads. Built local sparse
  analysis filesystem from new ranges with signed system caremap digest agreement.
- Owned bounded ext4 prototype found install-recovery.sh, recovery-from-boot.p
  and recovery-resource.dat; exact file hashes/sizes in reconstruction receipt.
  Read470,262bytes under64MiB cap, no mount, script/helper execution or raw-device
  access. Local prototypes/reports remain ignored system-inspection output.
- Script declares exact current recovery9,299,968bytes/SHA18e5e7f6f63fd77383c5721a13d818f880a1e70c9
  from exact stock boot plus patch/bonus. Packaged init.rc726 declares main-class
  oneshot flash_recovery service; class startup declarations are not execution proof.
- Source/asset-location gap resolved; exact patched bytes, live service acceptance,
  reachable post-failure return and usable real logs remain unqualified.

## 2026-10-27 — exact recovery result-byte verification (#346)

- CI healthy, dependency PR11 only. No owner recovery-mode approval received;
  automatic run did not access, enumerate or reboot the connected tablet.
- Read bounded primary AOSP IMGDIFF2 format source at
  b31f9ce6d150a264f584d9b38a54da0723fc249c; hash/URL retained in receipt.
  Implemented owned bounded file-only BSDIFF40/raw/deflate+bonus decoder; did not
  execute vendor applypatch/installer/unlock helper or mount a filesystem.
- Actual pinned inputs produced9,299,968bytes/SHA18e5e7f6f63fd77383c5721a13d818f880a1e70c9,
  exactly the signed OTA recovery target. SHA2564de74a18736f3652a96db33453b230b72b91a7dbbec7a4d046ee5c9408a167e2.
  Rechecked output bytes and boot-component layout; exact-stock kernel matches,
  size fits owner-reported recovery,2KiB trailer remains unclassified.
- Added malformed-format/capacity and exclusive publication controls; pinned
  output verification precedes fsync/exclusive host publication. Binary stays ignored.
  Next owner entry/return observation and independent failure/log qualification;
  no runtime hardware gate closed by this artifact result.
- Validation:309 host tests pass plus actual signed-target reconstruction and
  component/size checks; repository/community/link and whitespace guards pass.

## 2026-10-27 — exact recovery USB/log observation contract (#346 / #348)

- CI healthy; dependency PR11 only. Stock recovery-mode approval remains pending;
  no tablet/USB/network query or mode change in this automatic run.
- Bounded gzip/newc inspection of verified exact recovery records default.prop,
  recovery init, key file, adbd/recovery literals and fstab hashes under16MiB cap.
  Secure/nondebug defaults plus disabled adbd/conditional startup mean a normal
  shell must not be assumed. Static log menu/path literals are not runtime access.
- Exact current recovery res/keys hash equals the already checked bundled key
  file; candidate signer-material alignment persists, installed image not verified.
- Updated pending observation expectations: owner screen labels/ordinary return,
  no sideload/update selection or policy weakening to manufacture shell access.
  Raw static file data and private inspection script retained under ignored
  out/stock-return/recovery-inspection; public receipt is normalized metadata.
  No recovery/adbd/firmware/helper execution and no physical gate closed.

## 2026-10-27 — owner-observed stock recovery entry and ordinary return (#346/#347/#348)

- Owner explicitly approved the interactive recovery mode test. Identity reads
  confirmed douglas/KFDOWI and exact incremental build659664620.
- Command `adb reboot recovery` exited0. Private photo confirms stock recovery
  menu and view-recovery-logs label. Owner selected reboot-system and reported
  normal screen. Published only normalized metadata and source-photo SHA256.
- No firmware/helper execution, OTA upload, wipe or installation. Ordinary
  return passes; experimental failure recovery, OTA acceptance and usable
  retained boot-log capture remain untested. Next: owner log-view observation.

## 2026-10-28 — actual stock kernel log text observed (#348)

- Owner photos show recovery log selector and readable early kernel output.
  Published normalized text/photo hashes only, no raw household imagery.
- Actual visible low-level log reservation is128KiB at0x44600000, distinct from
  the legacy console candidate0x44400000. No freshness/backend format inferred.
- Interactive owner-approved adb get-state returned no device; narrow USB
  vendor enumeration found none. No bytes pulled. Owner cable reseat pending.
- No tablet actions in this automatic run. Full log/failure capture and physical
  UART qualification remain open. Source revision95df19f36e1b8f9134900a0525ae63896919f5ed.

## 2026-10-28 — targeted USB recovery-kernel archive export (#348)

- Owner returned to Android; interactive identity read reconfirmed douglas and
  build659664620. Tag-only --file listing367bytes; --print text663874bytes,
  SHA25625a703e1315c636794d26a586153d4051f4569bbf008e429eccff197bd3ba256.
- Two archived kernel entries; second matches five photographed markers. Both
  have trailing truncation markers, despite no local1MiB cap hit. Full log and
  exact session freshness not qualified; no experimental failure tested.
- Published normalized metadata and repeatable scoped procedure, raw text kept
  ignored/private0600. No broad bugreport or firmware/helper/security changes.
- Automatic run only analyzed supplied/captured local evidence, no tablet access.
  Next offline truncation/attribution investigation, then failure lifecycle gate.

## 2026-10-28 — reconcile acquired kernel layout with DT memory (#348/#106)

- Offline strict selected-line parsing of acquired second kernel archive entry;
  three PHY banks plus named ATF/consys regions form a contiguous partition of
  earlier DT usable banks. Kernel total1462080KiB plus2240KiB ATF/consys equals
  DT1464320KiB. Dynamic consys actual address0x98400000 now observed.
-2MiB console declaration/buffer initialization observed; old-valid contents and
  experimental retention remain unqualified. Top106MiB owner remains unknown.
- Normalized interval arithmetic asserts pass; no raw logs or household fields
  published and no tablet access during this automatic run. Next failure-lifecycle
  qualification, preserving truncation/freshness limits.

## 2026-10-28 — prevent blocked-task idle loops (#106)

- Owner requested a standing executable/fallback queue after repeated waiting
  turns. Added [active work queue](development/ACTIVE-WORK-QUEUE.md) with ordered
  tasks, acceptance criteria, current evidence and explicit external gates.
- Updated the existing heartbeat instructions: active work continues within turns;
  pending CI/owner input triggers independent queued work, not repeated polling.
  Preserved15-minute recovery trigger and meaningful-only notifications.
- Reconciled stale blanket device prohibition with owner standing low-brick-risk
  lab permission; high-brick-risk and large/paid resource gates remain.
- Current queue starts with exact320KiB truncation-stage investigation, then boot
  attribution, bounded loader-return rehearsal, diagnostic handoff and dependency-
  ready board work. No outstanding cable/photo/Android-return request.

## 2026-10-28 — identify packaged320KiB recovery archive collector (#348)

- Bounded static DEX instruction walk located BootReceiver in exact cached oat;
  user LOG_SIZE65536 and recovery last_kmsg call positive*5 feed unchanged maxSize
  into FileUtils.readTextFile with truncation marker. Both acquired normalized
  payloads equal327680bytes. This identifies packaged collector sizing.
- Initial private assertion used the wrong slice for final initializer words;
  corrected to last3:-1, then initializer and call-site word assertions passed.
- Public receipt contains hashes/offsets/semantic review only, no raw logs or DEX.
  Private purpose-specific parser is not a general verified disassembler; installed
  equivalence and cache-file completeness remain unverified. No device execution.
- Queue item1 source scope complete; next item2 archive attribution/coverage, then
  loading-return rehearsal. Do not repeat the same archive read for missing bytes.

- While archive-limit PR CI ran, queue item2 attribution/coverage analysis completed:
  second entry0..29.865148seconds/photo-consistent, first nonmonotonic. Collection
  Build/Kernel headers do not establish retained-boot identity. No tested
  experimental boot/failure and no lexical panic absence promoted to success.
  Normalized receipt updated. Next executable item3 loader-return rehearsal.

## 2026-10-28 — concrete loader/return rehearsal and diagnostic handoff (#346/#347/#348/#340)

- Queue3 source plan complete: R0 stock baseline passes, R1/R2 explicitly gate
  compatible bounded entry, region identity, independent failure return and
  attributable capture. First persistent effects and each unqualified exit are
  identified. No firmware/helper/electrical trial scheduled or approval requested.
- Standing low-risk read reconfirms douglas/build659664620 and boot_completed=1;
  direct cache/recovery/last_kmsg metadata denied and readability false. Captured
  normalized permissions only; no source log/raw block read or mode/security change.
- Queue4 source-review index complete with authenticated material, observed stock
  behavior/partialUSB capture, generic results and release/runtime gate separation.
  This does not close beta package/QA or high-risk recovery acceptance issues.
- Next executable queue5: select dependency-ready board task after live acceptance
  review; independently investigate one actual remaining R1 route prerequisite.

## 2026-10-28 — unresolved HDMI parent/consumer distinctions (#29)

- Selected live board task29 while recovery R1/R2 remain blocked. Reviewed pinned
  overlay/donor/legacy constructors and captured literal DT references.
- Legacy HDMI APLL aliases are1:1 aud_2_sel factors; captured audio uses distinct
  actual aud_apll2_div0 divider (shift28,width3,gate1,reg0x05a0). No substitution.
- Legacy CTS ends in clk_null; no valid hardware source/rate demonstrated. Captured
  direct DSI refs have different immediate edges, but no whole-board irrelevance
  inferred from absent literal HDMI/DPI refs. No provider behavior changed.
- Next trace matched CCF/non-DT consumers and HDMI PHY ownership/rates, then bound
  unavailable paths or implement valid relationships with compile evidence.
  Runtime support remains untested; project/issue stays Active with current result.

- During PR CI, traced actual legacy HDMI C probe and DT consumer: all named
  clocks requested with devm_clk_get and BUG_ON lookup failure. Legacy DT includes
  HDMI gates absent from captured candidate. Preserve PIXEL/PLLCK phandle/name
  ordering discrepancy; no validated driver mapping or hardware rate inferred.

## 2026-10-28 — matched HDMI PHY ownership and unavailable-consumer policy (#29)

- Donor directory metadata pinned; first source acquired then raw endpoint429.
  No immediate repeat. Read16195bytes from official matched ACK source; common
  probe/header Git blobs equal pinned donor, MT8173 implementation does not.
- Common provider needs real pll_ref, output name and matched PHY; supports
  MT2701/MT8173/MT8195, no MT8163 entry. Captured candidate has no HDMI PHY output.
  Legacy direct mode/deep-color PLL programming is not a fixed CTS rate proof.
- Existing CI audit now rejects7 unresolved dependent literal DT consumers while
  allowing real DSI/audio divider.3 targeted rejection tests added; no provider
  register/gating behavior changed. Full host/check results recorded with PR.
- Next evaluate exact aud_2_sel direct-parent equivalence for two legacy aliases,
  separate from unqualified CTS source. #29 remains Active; no hardware claim.

## 2026-10-28 — resolve real HDMI audio/SPDIF parent references (#29)

- Contracted two missing legacy ungated1:1 aliases to actual aud_2_sel in MMSYS.
  Gate IDs, bits11/12, registers and ops unchanged; no fixed rate or audsys divider
  substitution. All7 unqualified HDMI consumer restrictions retained.
- Textual orphan set now only hdmitx_dig_cts, still explicitly unavailable behind
  matched PHY/rate gate. This source change does not claim runtime HDMI/audio.
- Appropriate host/policy checks plus existing bounded generic kernel compile
  workflow are required before merge. No tablet/firmware operation.

## 2026-10-28 — exact topckgen binding coverage during provider compile (#27)

- #29 provider parent fix PR384 generic compile running; selected independent27
  cached exact-compatible work and synchronized issue/project/parent active state.
- Uncached MMSYS source request429; did not retry or invent its driver contract.
  Cached topckgen driver matches standalone MT8163 DT tuple; opt-in locked schema
  adds only that value. Actual full corpus53diagnostics (41unmatched/12validation),
  target unmatched removed, no added diagnostic; wrapper exit1 preserved.
-7 processed tuple controls pass; all non-compatible constraints exactly preserved.
  First extraction expected an id#suffix that processed corpus omits; corrected
  lookup before controls. No claimed full schema pass/runtime support.
- Next cached infracfg compatible/reset contract while exact-head provider compile
  continues. Raw source request limits do not block independent cached work.

## 2026-10-28 — infracfg compatible and required reset contract (#27)

- Continued independent source work while PR384 generic compile runs. Added
  opt-in exact MT8163+syscon and reset-required branch matching actual driver
  descriptor/probe. Two banks0x120/0x140; captured clock/reset cells1.
- Actual cached full corpus52diagnostics (40unmatched/12validation), target node
  unmatched removed with no added diagnostic; full wrapper exit1 preserved.
-11 processed-node controls pass, including missing/wrong reset rejection and
  preserved existing MT8173/MT8167 policies; all other constraints unchanged.
- Initial string replacement caught overmatching indentation before file writes;
  regenerated by exact complete-line identity and verified two enum additions.
  No runtime support claimed, no device/new corpus operation.

## 2026-10-28 — exact PLL binding and provider-instantiation gap (#27/#18)

- Added opt-in standalone apmixedsys compatible matching actual PLL probe/DT;
 9 processed-node controls pass, other constraints unchanged. Full cached corpus
 51diagnostics (39unmatched/12validation), target removed/no additions; exit1.
- Complete profile name exceeded255-byte component limit; preserve existing short
  names, hash long exact profile names with fullSHA256.3 path tests and actual
  compact-name full-context run pass. No new corpus/device operation.
- Small official ACK MMSYS parent source read15830bytes: no MT8163 match; child
  clock driver uses platformID clk-mt8163-mm and current port patches do not add
  parent creation. Generic compile is not provider instantiation. Recorded against
 18; needs matched SoC parent/routing/reset integration, not another schema count.
- PR384 still compiling; source work continues independently. Next actual parent
  integration investigation; never copy DRM display-path data into SoC match data.

## 2026-10-28 — four direct gate-provider exact contracts (#27)

- While actual parent fix compiled, qualified IMG/MFG/VDEC/VENC exact OF/syscon
  tuples against cached common schema and direct simple-probe drivers. New nodes
  require register mapping; old power-domain conditional preserved unchanged.
- Actual full cached context47diagnostics (35unmatched/12validation),4 target
  unmatched removed/no additions; wrapper exit1 preserved.31 processed-node
  controls pass, no media/GPU/runtime qualification implied.
- PR384 full generic Image and QEMU passed at18f2d5b; GitHub reports merge conflict
  after independent documentation/schema merges. Next resolve history, verify
  all compile inputs unchanged, and run required checks on final merged head.
  No unnecessary repeat full compilation of unchanged inputs is claimed as new.

- Generated patch context blank lines initially triggered whitespace diagnostics;
  reformatted context without altering applied YAML, verified isolated git apply
  output identity and reran full cached profile (47diagnostics/exit1 unchanged).
  Whitespace checks now pass before the correction commit.

## 2026-10-28 — actual parent-fix compile and merge-history resolution (#29)

- Generic compile/QEMU run40755681118 passed at18f2d5b. Image SHA256
  d7eb0fa46d5fe5141bcce9d9c48e774a15ce6cf9796efdd1c85005e6202942d9;
  config6a4c801a15e3e210948ccf7053bff6b83caffdcae5a431054af3dad1ed0ff8d5.
- Independent source work merged while compile ran. Resolved WORKLOG-only conflict
  preserving both histories;48 relevant build inputs match compiled revision byte
  for byte. No duplicate full compile of unchanged inputs claimed; final-head
  required repository/traceability/evidence checks rerun before merge.
- CTS remains deliberately unavailable behind tested consumer guard. Missing
  MMSYS parent creation is #18 integration, not corrected by generic compilation;
  no actual board boot/audio/HDMI or failure-return gate is closed here.

## 2026-10-28 — real MMSYS parent connection (#18)

- PR388 merged at532c20d after five exact-head checks;315 host tests passed.
- Acquired pinned routing header4157bytes/SHA256
  16a2ab928d4395a4b2463991c34e586ec39359143779cbfe26ab1a1221459489

  9fac0dd783e907ac8fdbbf1a32b660d18d890f828cff61f40ccc62e9b1f9802f.
- Added exact donor SoC descriptor/match and clock-child creation path via a
  hash-locked patch against ACK d9318bdb. Subsequent captured-consumer review found
  donor raw64 reset IDs conflict with compact DSI23. Corrected descriptor uses
  the34-entry map (DSI23 -> bit24); legacy LCM0x150 corrects donor bank2 to4.
  No DT consumers added. Original donor headers retained unchanged in evidence.
- Explicit MMSYS parent-object build now required. Isolated patch apply/hash
  check and reapply rejection pass. Generic Image/parent compile next via PR CI;
  board probe/reset/routing and failure recovery remain untested.

- Initial run40762643646 failed before C compilation: ACK modular CMDQ bounds
  MMSYS to module state. Pinned Kconfig confirms dependency; generic parent
  experiment disables CMDQ and requires MMSYS=y, preserving diagnostic isolation.
  Corrected-head run required; initial failure is not an Image result.

## 2026-10-28 — matched MMSYS schema during parent compilation (#27)

- PR389 parent integration is compiling independently. Cached ACK proposal adds
  exact MT8163 MMSYS/syscon tuple only; original constraints preserved structurally.
- Full profile46diagnostics (34unmatched/12validation), one target unmatched
  removed/no additions, wrapper exit1. Eleven processed-node controls pass.
  No source corpus download or device action. Does not prove reset IDs or probe.
- Next complete exact-head parent build/reset review under #18; full schema and
  actual device/recovery acceptance remain open. All evidence hashes and full
  profile command retained in evidence/mmsys-binding.

## 2026-10-28 — GPIO/EINT bank source acceptance (#19)

- While #389 builds, reviewed pinned ACK EINT17013bytes/SHA256
  c4c2fbdd4a34aa09c0db698328d7bcd80eaedfd98765392f37cdcf5a2ce92e39.
 18 register offsets,13 shared geometry fields and both masks match legacy/donor.
- Source-drift rejection controls cover changed EINT ACK address and AP capacity.
  Existing155 descriptors/15 mux references still checked; no runtime claim.
- Captured DT lists three parent SPIs; both ACK and actual legacy Git blob select
  index0. Inherited behavior, no new regression established. Parent-line ownership,
  delivery and GPIO87 input-enable delta remain unqualified. Next #18 actual
  compile result and #27 full binding work; no physical request is outstanding.

## 2026-10-28 — real pinctrl/EINT probe prerequisites (#27/#19)

- Exact MT8163 pinctrl tuple plus required reg/syscon/EINT/IRQ/cells declaration
  follows actual common probe. Old SoC/pin-group policies preserved structurally.
- Full cached context45diagnostics (33unmatched/12validation), one target removed,
  none added, wrapper exit1.19 controls use actual dtschema Draft201909/typeSize
  validation and four local processed dependencies, including phandle-array bounds.
- Parent IRQ delivery and GPIO87 remain unqualified; source matches do not close
  hardware gates. #389 real MMSYS Image build remains active, #391 bank audit
  merged after six exact-head checks including pinctrl object compile.

## 2026-10-28 — actual MMSYS parent/Image result (#18)

- Run40763077737 passed explicit MMSYS parent object, full generic ARM64 Image
  and QEMU diagnostic smoke at5c02907; MTK_MMSYS=y/CMDQ=n. No warning:/error:

  Full artifact/config/QEMU receipts: evidence/clock-port/mmsys-parent/compile-result.json.
- Independent #390/#391/#392 merged while build ran. Verified all selected
  provider/source-lock/input/config/build inputs byte-identical to compiled head;
  no duplicate compile of documentation/schema changes claimed. Final-head checks
  rerun before parent merge. Actual device probe/reset/routes and recovery open.
- #27 exact pinctrl probe contract merged in #392; full context45diagnostics,
  not passed. Next executable dependency is #20 power/provider source integration
  review and matched schemas under #27; no physical action requested.

## 2026-10-28 — actual power/domain source contract (#20)

- Pinned legacy Git snapshots compare eight IDs,32 domain register/SRAM fields,
  three nonzero bus-protection masks and two status offsets to ACK plus the real
  candidate. All values match; original headers/provenance retained. Drift checks
  reject changed register/protection values and unknown expression guessing.
- Recorded two policy differences: eight legacy active-wakeup=true callbacks
  versus candidate capability absent; mfg clock moves from MFG to MFG_ASYNC.
  No runtime equivalence or voltage/order claim follows from equal bitmasks.
- Recorded concrete probe effects in diagnostic evidence index: available power
  domains turn on during registration; pwrap enables DCM/clocks and can reset/
  initialize transport if INIT_DONE2 clear. Experimental DT boot is not read-only
  log collection. No device/firmware/helper action or new download performed.
- Next: matched pwrap/scpsys/domain binding prerequisites under #27, plus source
  qualification of wakeup/clock-order deltas. Loading/independent return and actual
  hardware gates remain open; no owner cable/photo/approval action requested.

## 2026-10-28 — wrapper prerequisites and real PMIC parent-name failure (#27/#20)

- #393 power audit merged after six exact-head checks including object compile.
  Matched pwrap binding requires real reset/PMIC child and excludes bridge
  resources absent from MT8163 descriptor; old policies preserved structurally.
- Matching RDMA context first exposed two PMIC parent naming errors (46diagnostics).
  Retained failures; isolated parent rename candidate preserves all880 property
  and phandle values across186 nodes against RDMA. No DT baseline mutation.
- New candidate DTB26259bytes/SHA256
  b837e6cb439d43778527c834e534abddb271170fd29cb6b13b174272214d1411;
  zero compiler diagnostics. Full context44diagnostics (32unmatched/12validation),
  wrapper exit1.22 actual processed-node controls preserve original SoC policies.
- Added CI compile/property-equivalence gate and phandle/path drift controls.
  No transport/rail/device or failed-boot recovery qualification implied. Next
  existing source scope: matched scpsys parent/power-controller dependencies under
  #27/#20 and explicit qualification of active-wakeup/clock-order differences.

## 2026-10-28 — actual scpsys parent/child and bus prerequisites (#27/#20)

- Pinned ACK OF platform source22288bytes/SHA256
  5c670486e3ec04cfe976d40b3cd4758c2ae2abe2176551cba0a8b7b75a1a3c85
  verifies normal simple-mfd child-creation source path, not actual device probe.
- Matched parent/child proposals bound eight IDs, nested domain cell range and
  protected INFRACFG requirements. Reject modern access-controllers mode (SoC
  block count defaults0) and ignored domain supplies (capability absent).
-24 actual decoded-node controls pass; full cached context42diagnostics
  (30unmatched/12validation), two matched nodes removed/no additions, wrapper1.
- Fresh-DTB guard checks eight unique IDs, MFG under MFG_ASYNC, actual INFRACFG
  phandle and clock/name counts. Six drift tests include wrong target/flattened
  hierarchy/duplicates/disabling domains; no bypass to obtain a pass.
- Next queued source investigation: legacy active_wakeup callback versus ACK
  GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP mapping and explicit MFG clock-order rationale under
  #20. Hardware voltage/order/wakeup and failed-boot return remain unqualified.
  No device/helper/firmware action performed; one small pinned source read only.

## 2026-10-28 — observed stock clock ABI and transition-order gate (#20/#347)

- Authorized bounded normal-Android USB reads confirm douglas/known incremental/
  completed boot. Sysfs/proc DT properties agree: mfg/mm clocks<6 70 6 67>,
  topckgen phandle6/#clock-cells1. Raw data stays ignored; normalized receipt only.
  First head command was absent; rejected error bytes, cat+host bounds succeeded.
- Candidate IDs54/51 differ; candidate70/67 are SCAM/ATB. Added explicit fresh-DTB
  provider/ID checks rejecting stock IDs and wrong provider despite valid counts.
  Loader R1 must qualify actual matching DTB selection/handoff; no trial performed.
- Source MFG mux fields and unit-alias parent identities match, but clock ownership
  moves MFG->MFG_ASYNC. OFF reset/clock and ON/ON_2ND write orders differ. Literal
  traces/legacy Boolean models are not hardware or ACK implementation equivalence.
- ACK genpd implementation unavailable from capped pinned endpoints; cached header
  contract alone does not justify capability changes. Moved immediately to cached
  transition/clock analysis and safe ABI evidence; no root/reboot/helper/flash.
- Next queued source scope: #347 trace actual candidate DTB selection/handoff
  from cached LK/FDT/load artifacts (out/lk-instruction-audit, out/lk-fastboot-review,
  out/lk-bootargs), identifying exact artifact/revision and image/address/trust
  boundaries; do not equate original-route source with installed LK3. No execution.
  #20 wakeup equivalence awaits the pinned ACK genpd implementation, not just its
  header. Actual matching DTB handoff, independent failure return and logs stay open.

## 2026-10-28 — cached LK version-selection prerequisite (#347)

- Static exact-OTA LK trace anchors root version lookup, missing-property rescan,
  string equality and selected-suffix path; bounded excerpts/hashes published in
  evidence/lk-dtb-selection. Candidate b837e6cb root version is absent; stock
  variants are pre_evt/hvt. No guessed version or firmware execution.
- Reproduction command and exact input hashes: LK-DTB-SELECTION.md/report.json.
  Installed LK3 equivalence, selector runtime provenance, destination bounds, late
  fixups and actual failure return remain unqualified. Next executable source
  acceptance: trace these producer/fixup boundaries from cached artifacts.

## 2026-10-28 — FDT destination and late-write source boundaries (#347)

- Extended merged #397's exact-OTA static trace: header+0x20 supplies FDT r1,
  fallback constructs0x40000100; header+0xc remains the separate kernel address.
  Rounded suffix copy precedes the in-place open capacity limit of at most1MiB;
  pre-copy bounds/overlap and runtime addresses remain unqualified.
- Pinned /memory/reg and selected /chosen atag writes: input DTB contents are not
  assumed preserved. K64 call r1=r5 checked, complete intervening lineage/SMC and
  installed LK3 equivalence remain open. See LK-FDT-DESTINATION.md and bounded
  evidence/lk-fdt-destination receipts (same exact LK SHA256 as #397).
- Four host controls replay sparse evidence and reject instruction/reference drift
  or truncation. No device action, firmware/helper execution or new download.
- Next executable source acceptance: memory-tuple producer and reservation/PSCI
  callbacks, then complete selected FDT lineage/trust checks. Runtime loading,
  independent return and failure-log gates remain Blocked.

## 2026-10-28 — selected runtime memory layout and reservation metadata (#347)

- Pinned exact-OTA helper0x25ac4: runtime pointer-global0x4bd874c0, count+0x30,
  records+0x38/stride24; selected caller capacity4. Start/size become16-byte
  big-endian DT tuples. Runtime pointer writer and alternate branch unqualified.
- Callback0x25bbc copies original-DRAM/mblock/LCA/TEE metadata and adds framebuffer
  reservation from globals. Actual geometry/ownership and remaining PSCI/fixups
  unqualified. Evidence/lk-memory-fixups includes bounded excerpts/window hashes.
- Owned host tuple decoder and five drift/64-bit/boundary/truncation controls
  pass; no firmware execution or actual runtime decoding claim. Reproduce using
  LK-MEMORY-FIXUPS.md with cached exact LK hash; raw artifact remains ignored.
- Next executable source acceptance: pointer-global writer/lifetime, alternate
  tuple branch, remaining reservation/PSCI callbacks and selected FDT lineage.
  Experimental loading/return/log gates remain blocked; no owner action needed.

## 2026-10-28 — entry-r4 bootarg capture and local memory pointer (#347)

- Exact-OTA startup stores incoming r4 at linked0x4bd00020. Initializer0x23230
  assigns local buffer0x4bd87340 to pointer-global0x4bd874c0; matching0x504c504c
  magic selects384-byte copy from saved entry pointer. Slots/instructions pinned
  in evidence/lk-memory-pointer; complete tag conversion/lifetime still open.
- Absolute pointer store precedes conditional relocation copy; file pointer slot
  is zero. Arbitrary load placement/pointer preservation cannot be assumed.
  No firmware execution or runtime failure claim; see LK-MEMORY-POINTER.md.
- Three sparse replay/drift/truncation controls pass. Next executable source
  acceptance: alternate tuple branch0x3e17c, remaining reservation/PSCI callbacks,
  selected FDT lineage/trust boundaries. Installed LK3/physical return/log gates
  remain Blocked; no owner physical action requested.

## 2026-10-28 — alternate rank branch and IDME dispatcher boundary (#347)

- Alternate0x3e17c guard is function presence: pinned GOT+0x380 points to actual
  mblock helper0x4bd25ac5, not a runtime mode flag. Unchanged artifact takes helper
  path. Alternate ranks use32-bit pairs/last-size adjustment and save/restore FDT
  r5; host model reports wrap rather than validating physical geometry.
- Dispatcher0x140 callback/context storage traced; one conditional setup writes
  Thumb target0x4bd00d85. Target looks up /idme and writes value/permission from
  context. No actual identifiers read/published; raw final-DTB capture must remain
  private with normalized technical facts only. No PSCI identity inferred.
- Evidence/lk-alternate-memory and LK-ALTERNATE-MEMORY.md pin exact LK hash,
  selected instruction windows/GOT slots and five replay/arithmetic controls.
  Sparse replay initially exposed missing instruction bytes; corrected window
  bounds and regenerated from the pinned artifact before validation.
- Next executable source acceptance: selected dispatcher setup and remaining
  PSCI/reservation edits, then full selected FDT lineage/trust inventory. Actual
  installed LK3/loading/failure return/log-retention gates remain Blocked.

## 2026-10-28 — actual selected CPU-node edits (#347)

- Callback0x258ec selected by nonzero GOT function pointer; /cpus cpu-node reg
  low-byte threshold selects node removal, retained clock-frequency only capped
  downward. Pinned seven-entry core table and frequency arithmetic; separate
  helper reads modeled independently. No actual CPU/rate or PSCI inference.
- Evidence/lk-cpu-fixup and LK-CPU-FIXUP.md pin exact LK hash, full selected
  windows, calls/strings/table and five replay/drift/selector controls. No device
  read, firmware/helper execution or new download.
- Next executable source acceptance: finite final-DTB mutation/entry/handoff
  coverage inventory across receipts, unresolved dispatcher setup/trust and
  minimum installed-LK3 evidence. Physical loading/return/log gates stay Blocked.

## 2026-10-28 — finite LK handoff coverage and evidence admission (#347)

- Consolidated nine pinned exact-OTA receipts into evidence/lk-handoff-coverage/
  manifest.json and LK-HANDOFF-COVERAGE.md. Cached source is explicitly distinct
  from installed LK3. Five gates: installed identity, bounded entry, matching
  final DTB, independent failure return and attributable retained failure log.
  All remain unqualified; no beta/loading admission inferred from source checks.
- Validator verifies receipt content hashes/one LK identity/completeness and
  rejects source-only runtime promotion. Four controls cover drift, duplicate/
  missing/external/cross-artifact receipts and attempted gate promotion.
  Command: python3 scripts/validate_lk_handoff_coverage.py; all source tests.
- Linked checklist from rehearsal/index and placed next acceptance at queue top.
  Next: compare existing cached loading/trust alternatives against checklist,
  select one viable nonpersistent bounded route or rule out with exact blockers.
  No cable/approval/device action requested; no firmware/helper execution.

## 2026-10-28 — route admission verdict and independent next task (#347/#27)

- Compared retained routes against all five handoff gates. Seven route classes,
  zero qualified nonpersistent trials. Pinned ten existing receipts in
  evidence/route-admission/review.json; CURRENT-ROUTE-ADMISSION.md records exact
  version/write/entry/protocol blockers and resolved owner/material prerequisites.
- No firmware/helper/device execution or new download. Source evidence does not
  prove no future route exists. Runtime recovery gates remain Blocked.
- Owner beta estimate: roughly15% engineering progress, not measured task fraction
  or remaining-time prediction; actual maintained-kernel/Android/hardware QA open.
- Next independent source acceptance #27: cached watchdog provider/probe/reset
  binding with actual negative controls; preserve full42-diagnostic baseline and
  distinguish source reset contract from actual failed-boot return.

## 2026-10-28 — matched MT8163 watchdog provider/probe/reset binding (#27)

- Added opt-in hash-locked MT8163 compatible/2..31sec timeout contract; all old
  SoC constraints preserved. Cached source OF match/15-reset descriptor pinned.
  Five offsets/four keys match exact legacy Git header; bit5 naming alone is not
  a changed write. Probe may reprogram already-running watchdog, not passive.
-19 actual decoded-node Draft201909/typeSize controls pass, including optional
  IRQ and existing-SoC positives. Corrected timeout mutations to decoded cell
  representation before acceptance. No DTB/driver/device change or download.
- Full cached wrapper42→41 diagnostics (29unmatched/12validation), only watchdog
  unmatched removed/no additions; exit1/passedfalse retained. Evidence and exact
  commands/hashes under evidence/watchdog-binding and WATCHDOG-BINDING.md.
- Next #27 source acceptance: pinctrl syscfg-parent resource/binding matching
  with actual controls. Runtime IRQ/reset/independent return/log gates remain open.

## 2026-10-28 — pinctrl syscfg provider/linkage/extent (#27)

- Added opt-in exact MT8163 pctl-a-syscfg/syscon binding in both selector/tuple
  enums, with all old policies preserved. Actual consumer resolves phandle14 to
 0x10005000+0x1000; EINT reg is distinct. Source type1[155,155) uses one regmap.
- Reviewed155 pins/119drive/46pull/92IES-SMT entries plus generic port/mux models;
  conservative end0xf5c fits4KiB. Fresh-DTB CI guard rejects wrong/missing/extra
  maps, disabled provider and wrong/undersized/expanded resources. No all-MMIO
  or hardware qualification. Source hashes verified from existing input locks.
-12 actual decoded-node schema controls pass; corrected unknown-property control
  to observed processed-schema rejection before acceptance. Full41→40 diagnostics
  (28unmatched/12validation), only provider unmatched removed/no additions, exit1.
- Exact receipts/commands: evidence/pinctrl-syscfg-binding and
  PINCTRL-SYSCFG-BINDING.md. No driver/DTB/device change or new download.
- Next #27 source acceptance: actual IOMMU/SMI probe/resource dependencies, then
  source-matched contracts; keep40 diagnostics and all runtime recovery gates open.

## 2026-10-28 — actual IOMMU/SMI source integration prerequisites (#27)

- Retrieved only two bounded pinned official ACK files (57941/33691bytes),
  retaining URLs/hashes; compared to cached donor20951722. Added80-line MT8163-
  only patch, preserving shared ACK probe/error policies and unrelated SoCs.
- Apply tool verifies revision/input/donor/patch/output hashes. Existing provider
  build now requires IOMMU/SMI symbols and both objects before Image/generic-QEMU
  checks. Source/host results are not compilation or hardware claims.
- Fresh-DTB dependency guard checks four larbs/common SMI, exact phandle/clock/
  domain roles and resources. Initial uniform4KiB assumption rejected actual64KiB
  larb1 declaration; corrected reviewed model without changing DTB. No binding
  added prematurely; all40 schema diagnostics remain.
- Inputs/commands/source effects: kernel/iommu-port/README.md and
  evidence/iommu-smi-port. No device/firmware execution or local kernel archive.
- Next acceptance after exact-head build: matched IOMMU/SMI binding contracts and
  actual node controls; runtime DMA/display/return/log qualification remains open.

## 2026-10-28 — pinned genpd wakeup core comparison (#20)

- Retried obsolete drivers/base/power/domain.c:404; acquired actual relocated
  drivers/pmdomain/core.c102206bytes and pm_wakeup.h7474bytes at pinned ACK
  d9318bdb. Official URLs and SHA256 receipts in evidence/power-port/wakeup-core.
- Exact legacy Git object and modern core/header establish16 Boolean branch
  combinations. Equal active policy matches only under stated already-off/OOB
  assumptions; prepare, noirq callback ordering, stop/start and errors differ.
- Candidate omits active-wakeup capability while eight legacy domains enable it;
  no automatic flag edit from narrow predicate equivalence. Missing-source blocker
  resolved; desired modern device wakeup policy and runtime transitions remain open.
- Reproduce: python3 scripts/validate_genpd_wakeup_comparison.py. No device/firmware
  execution. Independent source task completed while PR407 provider build runs.
- Next #20 acceptance: derive intended modern wakeup configuration and power
  transition behavior before any capability change; #27 source/build then matched
  IOMMU/SMI contracts remains the current queue priority.

## 2026-10-28 — actual IOMMU/SMI build and matched contracts (#27)

- PR407 merged6821d31282f9d533456a321417c6a2bb87196bf0 after five PR checks plus
  exact-head302e51a run40794335163. Real provider objects/Image and generic QEMU
  pass; normalized hashes/URL in evidence/iommu-smi-port/build-result.json. No
  MT8163 hardware probe. Prior run superseded after worklog conflict resolution.
- Three opt-in hash-locked source-matched contracts;60 actual decoded-node
  controls and structural old-SoC preservation pass. Corrected larb-ID mutation
  from array to decoded scalar to test actual range, not accidental type failure.
- Full context40→38 (22unmatched/16validation): six unmatched nodes selected and
  four larb interrupt errors exposed, no other delta. Selected SMI driver consumes
  no IRQ; candidate rejection remains visible. Wrapper exit1/passedfalse retained.
- Reproduce/check commands, hashes, portable schema/node receipts and full output
  under evidence/iommu-smi-binding; IOMMU-SMI-BINDINGS.md describes limits.
  No new source downloads, DTB/driver/device/firmware changes in binding scope.
- Next executable #27 acceptance: trace source ownership/origin of four larb IRQ
  declarations from cached sources before any DT correction. Runtime DMA/display/
  independent failed-boot return and retained logs remain open.

## 2026-10-28 — source-backed optional larb IRQ resources (#27)

- Exact legacy DTS declares SPI205/213/217/207 at the four larb addresses; donor
  retains them. Legacy matching larb probe maps memory/clocks/common link without
  IRQ request, while M4U maps its own node SPI147 and requests MTK_M4U_isr.
  Exact paths/hashes/line excerpts retained in evidence/larb-irq-contract.
- Preserve vendor hardware declarations rather than delete unhandled resources.
  MT8163-only optional single-IRQ schema preserves old-SoC IRQ prohibition and all
  unrelated prior constraints. Fresh-DTB guard checks declared vendor IRQ tuple.
-40 actual decoded-node controls pass, including unchanged nodes, optional
  absence, excess IRQs and old-SoC prohibition. Cardinality controls are separate
  from board-specific type/number/polarity guard; no claim of handler support.
- Full38→34 diagnostics: exactly four larb property errors removed, no additions;
 22unmatched/12validation remain, wrapper exit1/passedfalse. Historical409 receipts
  unchanged. No DTB/driver/device/firmware change or download.
- Exact reproduction commands/full diagnostics/provenance in evidence directory
  and LARB-IRQ-CONTRACT.md. Next #27 source acceptance: USB MUSB/T-PHY actual
  driver/OF/probe prerequisites before binding support; loader/return/log runtime
  gates remain open.

## 2026-10-28 — actual USB fallback/probe and variant prerequisites (#27)

- Acquired only two capped official ACK files (13649/46869bytes), pinned revision/
  URL/SHA256; legacy source/hash/line receipts from cached e0a3a2b. Both candidate
  fallbacks match actual tables, without proving MT8163 variant equivalence.
- Legacy resource1 SIF->io_priv->macro+0x800 and calibration0xf00-0x800+0x0c
  derive0x11210f0c; selected generic V1 SIF+0x100+0x0c derives0x1121010c. Legacy
  formulaFRA48 vs V1 default26 also differs. No MMIO/device observation inferred.
- Actual candidate controller and PHY disabled; diagnostic fragment requests
  USB/GADGET disabled. Probe/PHY operations are not passive. No reset dependency
  copied from siblings, no guessed DT property, no enabling/binding/build claim.
- Added fresh-DTB metadata/source audit and negative controls for enablement,
  resource/IRQ/clock/phandle/PHY-type drift. Report keeps variant/build/device
  readiness false. Exact receipts/report/commands: evidence/usb-prerequisites and
  USB-PREREQUISITES.md. Candidate SHA/full34 diagnostics unchanged.
- Next bounded #27 source acceptance: USB2 bank/calibration arithmetic/timeouts
  comparison and justified MT8163-specific variant/resource definition before
  source/build integration. Runtime loading/independent return/log gates open.
